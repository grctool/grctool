Appropriate technical and organizational measures shall be implemented to minimize the identified risks.&nbsp;</li>\\n<li>Test data and accounts are removed before a production system becomes active.</li>\\n<li>Change control procedures related to implementing security patches and software modifications are documented.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Baseline Configuration&nbsp;</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>{{organization.name}} shall consider developing, documenting and maintaining a current baseline configuration standard of the information systems and their components.</li>\\n<li>The baseline configuration standard of the information systems shall be updated as an integral part of the information system component installation.</li>\\n<li>The configuration standard addresses all known security vulnerabilities and is in line with industry-recognized device hardening standards.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.1 Change Initiation and Impact Analysis</strong></h3>\\n<p>All changes, both scheduled and unscheduled, shall be documented, classified into and tracked:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Low impact: affects &lt; 1% of individuals</li>\\n<li>Medium impact: affects between 1% and 5% of individuals</li>\\n<li>High impact: affects &gt; 5% individuals</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>The documentation must identify the scope of the change, areas affected, back-out process, test plan, communication plan and the planned deployment date.</p>\\n<p>Business and technical risks (including the potential impact on performance and security) and costs must be formally considered part of the impact assessment and documented in the change record before submitting for approval. In addition, an implementation plan detailing all the stages required to successfully manage the change (including a test plan and roll-back strategy) shall be developed as part of this phase.</p>\\n<h3><strong>3.2 Change Approval and Implementation</strong></h3>\\n<p>Changes shall be approved formally prior to commencing the change or development and prior to implementing the fully-tested change into the live environment.</p>\\n<p>Impact across the organization and involvement of representatives from other business units will be considered depending on the impact on other business services.</p>\\n<h3><strong>3.3 Post-Implementation Review</strong></h3>\\n<p>A post-implementation review shall be performed to evaluate whether the desired result has been achieved. In the event that a change does not perform as expected or causes issues to one or more areas of the production environment, the attendees of the change meeting will determine if the change should be removed and the production environment returned to its prior stable state.</p>\\n<h3><strong>3.4 Denials</strong></h3>\\n<p>The Business Owner or Change Advisory Board (CAB) or their designee may deny a scheduled or unscheduled change for reasons including, but not limited to:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Inadequate change planning or unit testing</li>\\n<li>Lack of stakeholder acceptance (where applicable)</li>\\n<li>System integration or interoperability concerns</li>\\n<li>Missing or deficient roll-back plans</li>\\n<li>Security implications and risks</li>\\n<li>Timing of the change negatively impacts key business processes</li>\\n<li>Timeframes do not align with resource scheduling (e.g., late-night, weekends, holidays or special events)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.5 Emergency Changes</strong></h3>\\n<p>Changes that can not follow the normal process because of their urgency (such as service outages) shall be considered emergency changes because they require immediate attention and must be implemented quickly to avoid disruption.</p>\\n<p>Approvals shall be obtained for such changes in the form of a discussion with a relevant service manager. Such changes shall be assessed and formally approved retrospectively. In addition, such changes shall be discussed during the periodic Business Owner or CAB meetings for analysis of lessons learned, root cause, impact and status.</p>\\n<h3><strong>3.6 Standard Changes and Patching</strong></h3>\\n<p>Standard changes (also called &ldquo;routine changes&rdquo;) tend to be pre-authorized changes that are considered to have little to no risk associated with them. These changes (for example, applying security patches) are already pre-approved by IT Management, so they can be executed without following the change management approval workflow.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>All systems shall be patched and updated on a documented, regular and timely schedule. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is recommended to be used to aid in setting patching guidelines.</p>\\n<p>The organization must identify systems affected by announced software or firmware flaws, including potential vulnerabilities resulting from these flaws.

Such controls include:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Only accepting trusted keys and certificates, that protocols in use only support secure versions or configurations, and encryption strength is appropriate for the encryption methodology in use.</li>\\n<li>Confidential or sensitive information transmitted in email messages is encrypted. Any confidential or sensitive information transmitted through a public network (e.g., internet) to and from vendors, customers or entities doing business with {{organization.name}} must be encrypted or transmitted through an encrypted tunnel virtual private networks (VPNs) or point-to-point tunneling protocols (PPTP) that includes current TLS implementations.</li>\\n<li>Use of VPNs and firewalls with strict access controls that authenticate the identity of those individuals accessing confidential or sensitive information.</li>\\n<li>Wireless (Wi-Fi) transmissions used to access {{organization.name}} computing devices or internal networks must be encrypted using current wireless security standard protocols (e.g., RADIUS, WPS private/public keys or other industry-standard mechanisms).</li>\\n<li>Secure encrypted transfer of documents and confidential or sensitive information over the internet using current secure file transfer programs such as Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) (FTP over SSH) and Secure Copy Command (SCP).</li>\\n<li>All administrative access, such as browser or web-based management tools, is encrypted using TLS based browser technologies using the most current security algorithm.</li>\\n<li>For Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI), employ FIPS-validated encryption, to protect CUI in transit and in process.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>When possible, public cloud configurations ensure all traffic between internal systems happens only on internal networks and does not go out to the public internet and then back into the internal systems.</p>\\n<h3><strong>3.3 Encryption Standards for Devices</strong></h3>\\n<p>All new laptops, tablets and portable storage devices purchased through IT will be supplied with encryption pre-installed and enabled. All USB storage devices must have encryption applied through an appropriate software tool.</p>\\n<h2><strong>4.0 Encryption Key Management Policy</strong></h2>\\n<p>Effective enterprise public and private key management is a crucial element in ensuring system security. Key management procedures must ensure that authorized users can access and decrypt all encrypted confidential or sensitive information using controls that meet operational needs.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>{{organization.name}}'s key management systems shall be characterized by the following security precautions and attributes:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>{{organization.name}} should use procedural controls to enforce the concepts of least privilege and separation of duties for staff. These controls apply to persons involved in encryption key management or who have access to security-relevant encryption key facilities and processes, including Certificate Authority (CA) and Registration Authority (RA) and/or contractor staff.</li>\\n<li>Keys in storage and transit must be encrypted.</li>\\n<li>Private keys must be kept confidential.</li>\\n<li>Application and system resource owners should be responsible for establishing data encryption policies that grant exceptions based on demonstration of a business need and assessing the risk of unauthorized access to or loss of confidential or sensitive information.</li>\\n<li>Decryption keys shall not be associated with user accounts to avoid issues once they have left the organization.</li>\\n<li>Restrict access to cryptographic keys to the fewest number of custodians necessary. Cryptographic keys are stored in the fewest possible locations.</li>\\n<li>Retirement or replacement (for example, archiving, destruction and/or revocation) of keys should be done when the integrity of the key has been weakened or keys are suspected of being compromised.</li>\\n<li>{{organization.name}} shall prevent the unauthorized substitution of cryptographic keys.</li>\\n<li>Archived cryptographic keys should only be used for decryption or verification purposes.</li>\\n<li>Cryptographic key custodians shall formally acknowledge that they understand and accept their key-custodian responsibilities.</li>\\n<li>{{organization.name}} shall maintain a documented cryptographic architecture that includes the list of key types, key length and usage period (expiry date). {{organization.name}} shall ensure that the key length is sufficient to comply with the current state of the art, including a transactional data symmetric security level of at least:&nbsp;\\n<ul>\\n<li>80 bits for data stored less than 5 years; or &nbsp;</li>\\n<li>128 bits for data to be stored for a period of 5 years or more.&nbsp;</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<div>\\n<div>\\n<p>Additionally, {{organization.name}} shall ensure updates of the keys in due time in accordance with this policy.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n<h3><strong>4.1 Requirements for Encryption Keys and Digital Certificates</strong></h3>\\n<p>{{organization.name}} must use industry-approved strong algorithms for encryption and/or digital signing processes.

As a result, this policy establishes information security risk management requirements to perform periodic Risk Assessments (RAs) to determine security risks in corporate operations, products and services and initiate appropriate remediation.</p>\\n<h2><strong>2.0 Scope</strong></h2>\\n<p>This policy applies to all operations, products, services, information assets and information systems that are owned and operated by {{organization.name}}, including (but not limited to) applications, databases, servers and networks, and any process or procedure by which these systems are administered and/or maintained. RAs can be conducted on any entity within {{organization.name}} or any outside entity that has signed a third-party agreement with {{organization.name}}.</p>\\n<h2><strong>3.0 Policy</strong></h2>\\n<p>{{organization.name}} shall establish a risk management framework aligned with business objectives that establish rules governing how to identify risks, assign risk ownership, how the risks impact the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the information and the method of treatment for identified risks. A formal risk assessment methodology shall be approved by management.</p>\\n<p>The risk management framework shall include guidelines for identifying and estimating the cost of protective measures to eliminate or reduce the security risks to an acceptable level.</p>\\n<p>All operations, products, services, information assets and information systems that are owned and operated by {{organization.name}} must be assessed for risks that result from threats to the integrity, availability and confidentiality of {{organization.name}}&rsquo;s data. Organization shall purchase a cyber security insurance policy that includes coverage for incident response and recovery activities.</p>\\n<p>The risk assessment shall be conducted/reviewed periodically, and any changes shall be communicated to relevant individuals/teams as appropriate.

Secure coding practices are enforced using static analysis, dynamic analysis, and dependency scanning tools integrated within the CI/CD pipeline.</p>\\n<p><strong>3.2.1 Feature Development</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Lightweight Specifications:</strong> Features to be developed are described with brief user stories or issue descriptions focused on user outcomes. Technical specifications, if needed, should be concise.</li>\\n<li><strong>Feature Toggles:</strong> Incorporate feature toggles/flags to enable deployment of incomplete work to staging or production environments (behind a toggle) for early testing and feedback.</li>\\n<li><strong>Feature Branches:</strong> Feature branches should be short-lived and merged into <code>master</code> within a few days. During the development process, changes from master should be integrated into the feature branch on an ongoing basis.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.2.2 Pull Requests</strong></p>\\n<p>Pull Requests (PRs) are the primary mechanism for code review and integration in our continuous delivery environment. To ensure quality and timely integration, the following requirements apply to all pull requests:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Automated Reviews:</strong>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Code analysis tools (e.g., static code checkers)</li>\\n<li>Unit tests</li>\\n<li>Security scans (e.g., dependency scanning for vulnerabilities)</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li><strong>Successful execution of these automated checks is mandatory</strong> before a PR can be merged into the <code>master</code> branch. Results must be addressed within the PR.</li>\\n<li><strong>Asynchronous Review:</strong> While senior developer review remains valuable, the focus should be on code quality, architecture, and integration considerations. Leverage the automated test suite and linting tools to catch common errors.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.2.2.1 Additional Considerations:</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Reviewers should not be the same person who authored the PR.</li>\\n<li>Pull request comments should document any new dependencies introduced or database migration requirements.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.2.2.2 Post-Review Actions</strong></p>\\n<p>Once the pull request is reviewed, it can be:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Approved and merged into master:</strong> The reviewer comments on the PR indicating approval.</li>\\n<li><strong>Rejected with changes:</strong> The reviewer comments with necessary changes. After changes are made by the developer, the PR will be re-reviewed for approval.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>After a pull request is reviewed, approved, and merged, the associated feature branch may be deleted.</p>\\n<p><strong>3.2.2.3 Merge Strategy</strong></p>\\n<p>To maintain a clear and easy-to-follow code history, developers must follow the following guideliens for how pull requests are merged:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Fast-forward and Squash Merges Preferred:</strong> For clean and linear Git history, we recommend using fast-forward merges or squash merges whenever possible. These merge strategies minimize the number of commits in the <code>master</code> branch, making it easier to track code evolution.</li>\\n<li><strong>Branch Merges (With Caution):</strong> Branch merges should only be used in rare cases where preserving the individual commits in the feature branch is crucial. This could be for debugging purposes or if the feature branch has a complex history that needs to be maintained separately.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.2.2.3 Commit Message Formatting</strong></p>\\n<p>For \\\"final\\\" commit messages that will be included in the master branch history, developers shall follow the LKML guidelines for informative commit messages. These guidelines emphasize a short subject line describing the change followed by a more detailed body explaining the reasoning and potential impact. Please also observe the following best practices as outlined at&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://cbea.ms/git-commit/\\\">https://cbea.ms/git-commit/</a></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#separate\\\">Separate subject from body with a blank line</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#limit-50\\\">Limit the subject line to 50 characters</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#capitalize\\\">Capitalize the subject line</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#end\\\">Do not end the subject line with a period</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#imperative\\\">Use the imperative mood in the subject line</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#wrap-72\\\">Wrap the body at 72 characters</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#why-not-how\\\">Use the body to explain&nbsp;<em>what</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>why</em>&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;<em>how</em></a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.2.3 Releases</strong></p>\\n<p>To manage releases in a continuous deployment environment, the following steps shall be followed:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li><strong>Tag for Release:</strong> When code on the <code>master</code> branch is considered production-ready, a new release tag shall be created following semantic versioning principles (e.g., v1.2.0).</li>\\n<li><strong>Create Release:</strong> A new Release shall be drafted and linked to the created tag. The release shall include detailed notes outlining all relevant changes.</li>\\n<li><strong>Trigger Deployment:</strong> The CI/CD pipeline will be automatically executed upon the new release, handling the build, test, and deployment process to production.</li>\\n<li><strong>Monitor Post-Release:</strong> Production systems shall be closely monitored to quickly identify and address any issues that may arise after deployment.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><strong>3.2.4 Hotfixes</strong></p>\\n<p>When a critical bug is discovered in production, developers shall follow the following procedure for expedited hotfixes:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li><strong>Hotfix Branch:</strong> Create a hotfix branch directly off the <code>master</code> branch. Clearly name it to indicate its purpose (e.g., <code>hotfix/critical-security-issue</code>).</li>\\n<li><strong>Apply Fix:</strong> Implement the fix on the hotfix branch.</li>\\n<li><strong>Pull Request:</strong> Create a pull request to merge the hotfix into <code>master</code>. While standard reviews apply, prioritize urgency in this case.</li>\\n<li><strong>Automated Deployment:</strong> The CI/CD pipeline will automatically build, test, and deploy the hotfix to production once it's merged into <code>master</code>.</li>\\n<li><strong>Tag for Tracking:</strong> Although a full release isn't necessary, create a release tag on <code>master</code> to track the hotfix deployment.</li>\\n<li><strong>Regression Testing:</strong> Write a test case, if applicable, to prevent the bug from reappearing.

We prioritize the use of open standards for instrumentation and data collection:</p>\\n<p><strong>3.7.1 Error Handling</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>User-Facing Errors:</strong> Error messages displayed to users must be generic and avoid revealing any internal system details or sensitive data that could be exploited by attackers.</li>\\n<li><strong>Sanitization:</strong> Log files and any error output must be sanitized to ensure they never contain passwords, API keys, session tokens, or other sensitive credentials.</li>\\n<li><strong>Production vs. Non-Production:</strong> Detailed error messages with stack traces may be exposed in development and testing environments, but never in production.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.7.2 Logging, Observability, and OpenTelemetry</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Centralized Logging:</strong> Logs from all systems shall be aggregated into a centralized log management system, ideally one integrated into a broader observability platform.</li>\\n<li><strong>Logging Levels:</strong> Employ a structured logging scheme with clear severity levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL).</li>\\n<li><strong>OpenTelemetry Instrumentation:</strong> Utilize OpenTelemetry (OTel) for instrumenting applications and infrastructure, aiming to collect logs, metrics, and traces.</li>\\n<li><strong>Essential Log Data:</strong> Log entries shall include, at a minimum:\\n<ul>\\n<li>Timestamp with timezone</li>\\n<li>System or component identifier</li>\\n<li>User identifier (if relevant)</li>\\n<li>Event description</li>\\n<li>Severity level</li>\\n<li>IP address or source identifier</li>\\n<li><strong>OpenTelemetry Trace IDs and Span IDs:</strong> For distributed tracing and correlation</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Access to log files and the observability platform must be restricted to authorized personnel, with role-based permissions enforced.</li>\\n<li><strong>Retention and Rotation:</strong> Define a log retention policy aligned with security, operational, and potential compliance requirements. Implement log rotation procedures.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.7.3 Additional Considerations</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Input Validation:</strong> Log data from user input should be treated as untrusted and subject to input validation to prevent log injection attacks.</li>\\n<li><strong>Audit Logging:</strong> Maintain separate audit logs focused on security-related events (logins, privilege changes, data access, etc.), ensuring these integrate with observability systems.</li>\\n<li><strong>Log Analysis, Alerting, and Tracing:</strong>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Configure automated alerting for critical events or anomalous activity.</li>\\n<li>Leverage observability tools to visually correlate OTel data, allowing for rapid debugging across distributed environments.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.8 Data Protection</strong></h3>\\n<p>{{organization.name}} is committed to safeguarding data throughout its lifecycle. The following principles form the foundation of our data protection practices:</p>\\n<p><strong>3.8.1 Principle of Least Privilege</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Access to data shall be granted on a need-to-know basis, with permissions strictly aligned with job responsibilities.</li>\\n<li>Role-based or attribute-based access control (RBAC or ABAC) models shall be used to enforce granular permissions.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.8.2 Data Minimization</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Collection and storage of sensitive data shall be limited to what is strictly necessary to fulfill business purposes.</li>\\n<li>Temporary data copies must be securely erased immediately after their intended use.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.8.3 Credential Protection</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Passwords and other sensitive credentials shall never be stored in plaintext.</strong> Use robust, modern password hashing algorithms specifically designed for the task (e.g., Argon2id, scrypt, bcrypt).</li>\\n<li>Each password or credential must utilize a unique, cryptographically random salt.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.8.4 Data in Transit</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>All data transmission, internally and externally, must occur over secure, encrypted channels using Transport Layer Security (TLS).</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.8.5 Web Application Security</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Prevent Data Exposure:</strong> Client-side code shall be stripped of application comments that could reveal sensitive information.</li>\\n<li><strong>Avoid GET Parameters:</strong> Never transmit sensitive data within GET request parameters.</li>\\n<li><strong>Manage Caching:</strong> Properly configure response headers to disable caching on any pages that display or process sensitive information.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.8.6 Data in Non-Production Environments</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>The use of production data in non-production environments (e.g., development or testing) is strongly discouraged.</li>\\n<li>If absolutely necessary, production data must be:\\n<ul>\\n<li>Masked or de-identified to protect any personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive data.</li>\\n<li>Access restricted exclusively to authorized personnel.</li>\\n<li>Usage subject to documented approvals and justifications.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.9 Communication Security</strong></h3>\\n<p>{{organization.name}} is committed to safeguarding data in transit. The following principles guide our communication security practices:</p>\\n<p><strong>3.9.1 Mandatory Encryption</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>All communication of sensitive data, both internally and externally, must occur exclusively over encrypted channels.</li>\\n<li>Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the mandated encryption protocol. Use version 1.2 or higher, with a strong focus on the most recent stable versions (e.g., TLS 1.3).</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.9.2 Cipher Suite Configuration</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Only modern, strong cipher suites shall be supported. Disable legacy cipher suites known to be vulnerable.</li>\\n<li>Regularly review and update supported cipher suites as new vulnerabilities emerge or standards evolve.</li>\\n<li>Resources like Mozilla's SSL Configuration Generator can aid in selecting secure TLS configurations.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.9.3 Certificate Management</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Use valid, trusted certificates issued by recognized Certificate Authorities (CAs) for all TLS connections.</li>\\n<li>Employ certificate pinning (with caution) or mechanisms like Certificate Transparency Logs for added verification.</li>\\n<li>Implement robust certificate lifecycle management, including timely renewals and revocation processes.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.9.4 Fail Secure</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Never allow fallback to plaintext communication if a TLS connection fails. Systems must always negotiate a secure, encrypted connection according to the configured cipher suites.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.9.5 Additional Considerations</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Web Applications:</strong>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Enforce the use of HTTPS for all web traffic. Use HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) headers to prevent downgrade attacks.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li><strong>Email:</strong>\\n<ul>\\n<li>For sensitive email communications, consider email encryption solutions such as S/MIME or PGP. Be aware of the complexities of email key management.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li><strong>API Endpoints:</strong>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms on external APIs and enforce the strict use of TLS.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Cross-Reference:</strong> This policy aligns with and extends guidelines set forth in the Key Management and Cryptography Policy.</p>\\n<h2><strong>4.0 Customer Notification</strong></h2>\\n<p>As currently available products and services are regularly assessed and reviewed, {{organization.name}} will notify the designated customer contacts within 24 hours if a high-risk vulnerability is found. {{organization.name}} will provide a plan to address the issue and a timeline for when the software or service will have a solution available.

In addition, it applies to all business units that operate within {{organization.name}}&rsquo;s network environment or utilizes its information resources.</p>\\n<h2><strong>3.0 Policy</strong></h2>\\n<p>Changes to information resources shall be managed and executed according to a formal change control process.

Appropriate technical and organizational measures shall be implemented to minimize the identified risks.&nbsp;</li>\\n<li>Test data and accounts are removed before a production system becomes active.</li>\\n<li>Change control procedures related to implementing security patches and software modifications are documented.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Baseline Configuration&nbsp;</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>{{organization.name}} shall consider developing, documenting and maintaining a current baseline configuration standard of the information systems and their components.</li>\\n<li>The baseline configuration standard of the information systems shall be updated as an integral part of the information system component installation.</li>\\n<li>The configuration standard addresses all known security vulnerabilities and is in line with industry-recognized device hardening standards.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.1 Change Initiation and Impact Analysis</strong></h3>\\n<p>All changes, both scheduled and unscheduled, shall be documented, classified into and tracked:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Low impact: affects &lt; 1% of individuals</li>\\n<li>Medium impact: affects between 1% and 5% of individuals</li>\\n<li>High impact: affects &gt; 5% individuals</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>The documentation must identify the scope of the change, areas affected, back-out process, test plan, communication plan and the planned deployment date.</p>\\n<p>Business and technical risks (including the potential impact on performance and security) and costs must be formally considered part of the impact assessment and documented in the change record before submitting for approval. In addition, an implementation plan detailing all the stages required to successfully manage the change (including a test plan and roll-back strategy) shall be developed as part of this phase.</p>\\n<h3><strong>3.2 Change Approval and Implementation</strong></h3>\\n<p>Changes shall be approved formally prior to commencing the change or development and prior to implementing the fully-tested change into the live environment.</p>\\n<p>Impact across the organization and involvement of representatives from other business units will be considered depending on the impact on other business services.</p>\\n<h3><strong>3.3 Post-Implementation Review</strong></h3>\\n<p>A post-implementation review shall be performed to evaluate whether the desired result has been achieved. In the event that a change does not perform as expected or causes issues to one or more areas of the production environment, the attendees of the change meeting will determine if the change should be removed and the production environment returned to its prior stable state.</p>\\n<h3><strong>3.4 Denials</strong></h3>\\n<p>The Business Owner or Change Advisory Board (CAB) or their designee may deny a scheduled or unscheduled change for reasons including, but not limited to:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Inadequate change planning or unit testing</li>\\n<li>Lack of stakeholder acceptance (where applicable)</li>\\n<li>System integration or interoperability concerns</li>\\n<li>Missing or deficient roll-back plans</li>\\n<li>Security implications and risks</li>\\n<li>Timing of the change negatively impacts key business processes</li>\\n<li>Timeframes do not align with resource scheduling (e.g., late-night, weekends, holidays or special events)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.5 Emergency Changes</strong></h3>\\n<p>Changes that can not follow the normal process because of their urgency (such as service outages) shall be considered emergency changes because they require immediate attention and must be implemented quickly to avoid disruption.</p>\\n<p>Approvals shall be obtained for such changes in the form of a discussion with a relevant service manager. Such changes shall be assessed and formally approved retrospectively. In addition, such changes shall be discussed during the periodic Business Owner or CAB meetings for analysis of lessons learned, root cause, impact and status.</p>\\n<h3><strong>3.6 Standard Changes and Patching</strong></h3>\\n<p>Standard changes (also called &ldquo;routine changes&rdquo;) tend to be pre-authorized changes that are considered to have little to no risk associated with them. These changes (for example, applying security patches) are already pre-approved by IT Management, so they can be executed without following the change management approval workflow.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>All systems shall be patched and updated on a documented, regular and timely schedule. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is recommended to be used to aid in setting patching guidelines.</p>\\n<p>The organization must identify systems affected by announced software or firmware flaws, including potential vulnerabilities resulting from these flaws. Security-relevant patches, service packs, hotfixes and anti-virus signatures should be reported to designated personnel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>During security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, and system error handling, flaws discovered should be addressed.</p>\",\"version_num\":3,\"master_version_num\":11,\"created\":\"2021-12-17T14:42:00.780588Z\",\"updated\":\"2024-05-04T18:35:18.853475Z\",\"published_by_id\":99999,\"published_date\":\"2024-05-04T18:35:18.841391Z\",\"review_date\":null,\"status\":\"published\",\"no_rfp_usage\":false,\"category\":\"Security Operations\",\"master_policy_id\":53,\"org_id\":12345,\"id\":94626,\"__entity_type__\":\"policy\",\"__permissions__\":[\"policy:manage_groups\",\"policy:assign\",\"policy:manage_versions\",\"policy:delete\",\"policy:manage_tags\",\"policy:manage_acl\",\"policy:view_details\",\"policy:edit\",\"policy:export_to_evidence\",\"policy:manage_events\",\"policy:deprecate\",\"policy:create_version\",\"policy:upgrade\",\"policy:view_awareness\",\"policy:reset_training\",\"policy:mark_not_applicable\",\"policy:set_review_date\",\"policy:create_event\",\"policy:set_reviewer\",\"policy:export\",\"policy:add_org_evidence\",\"policy:comment\",\"policy:unpublish\",\"policy:manage_settings\"],\"tags\":[],\"assignees\":[{\"first_name\":\"Test\",\"last_name\":\"User\",\"has_reviewed_name\":true,\"is_owner\":true,\"created\":\"2022-01-09T21:25:23.859312Z\",\"updated\":\"2025-01-09T05:00:00.600811Z\",\"suspended\":false,\"training_completed\":null,\"training_expiry_date\":\"2026-01-09\",\"display_name\":\"Test User\",\"short_display_name\":\"TU\",\"pendo_enabled\":true,\"org_id\":12345,\"org\":12345,\"user_id\":99999,\"attachment_id\":null,\"org_role_id\":3,\"id\":888888,\"__entity_type__\":\"organization_member\",\"attachment\":null,\"user\":{\"id\":888888,\"__entity_role__\":null,\"__entity_type__\":\"user\",\"__permissions__\":[\"user:reset_password\",\"user:set_password\",\"user:generate_backup_codes\",\"user:request_email_change\",\"user:add_auth_factor\"],\"email\":\"test@example.com\",\"last_login\":\"2025-07-01T17:47:45.693357Z\",\"status\":\"active\",\"is_locked_out\":null,\"locked_out_until\":null}}],\"current_version_status\":null,\"read_time\":6,\"reviewers\":[]},{\"name\":\"Corporate Ethics\",\"summary\":\"The organization values ethics, trust and integrity throughout its business practices.\",\"details\":\"<h1 style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><strong>{{organization.name}} Corporate Ethics Policy</strong></h1>\\n<h2><strong>1.

When a patch is available, an authorized system administrator must enter a change ticket according to {{organization.name}}&rsquo;s Change Management Policy. All patches should be tested (where applicable) on test systems before being rolled out to production, where possible.</p>\\n<p>In case patches cannot follow the defined schedule, a document must be produced explaining why the patch must be deferred. Permissible deferrals may include a lack of appropriate change windows within the appropriate timeframe or a conflict with other critical changes scheduled at that time. Approvals shall be granted by a senior member of the IT team.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>IT/Information Security is responsible for performing a vulnerability scan on systems after each patch window to show that the patches were installed correctly.&nbsp; Vulnerability scan reports should be reviewed periodically.</p>\\n<h3><strong>3.5 Decommissioning a Server</strong></h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>{{organization.name}} shall define a process for decommissioning servers. This process will be different for virtual servers and physical servers.</li>\\n<li>The data on the servers must be completely destroyed before the machine is taken out of service. The machine should be labeled accordingly.</li>\\n<li>Ensure the shared responsibility with cloud providers and how cloud providers delete customer data when a virtual server is deleted.</li>\\n<li>Ensure cloud provider(s) have appropriate controls around wiping and destruction of hardware.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.6 Compliance&nbsp;</strong></h3>\\n<p>Periodic audits will be performed as authorized by {{organization.name}} management.

This document establishes guidelines for the development of software and systems that are required to be applied to all developments to ensure their maintainability, security and protection against cyber-attacks and accessibility.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>This policy provides for secure and privacy-aware methodologies during the design and implementation of {{organization.name}}&nbsp; products and services. It incorporates best practices in software and operations design and implementation processes with security, privacy and vulnerability reviews throughout their lifecycle so that implementation ensures that {{organization.name}} products are only used as intended and are not vulnerable to attack or abuse. The goal of {{organization.name}} software practices is to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information resources in order to enable secure and successful business operations.</p>\\n<h2><strong>2.0 Scope</strong></h2>\\n<p>This policy covers all development activities carried out by the DevOps team during the design, implementation and maintenance of {{organization.name}} products and services. {{organization.name}} follows a branching strategy workflow for source control and uses the principles outlined in the <a href=\\\"https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/OWASP_SCP_Quick_Reference_Guide_v2.pdf\\\">OWASP Secure Coding Practices</a> to train the DevOps team and defend against the <a href=\\\"https://owasp.org/Top10/\\\">OWASP Top 10</a> security vulnerabilities.</p>\\n<h2><strong>3.0 Policy</strong></h2>\\n<h3><strong>3.1 Design Process</strong></h3>\\n<p>{{organization.name}} DevOps team will consider the security implications of any feature development and/or enhancement to ensure the security and stability of {{organization.name}}&rsquo;s application. Things to consider are:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>How can this feature be misused?</li>\\n<li>Does this feature cause unnecessary data exposure?</li>\\n<li>Does this feature expose an attack vector?</li>\\n<li>Are the data sources used by the feature trusted or untrusted?</li>\\n<li>Does the feature follow the privacy principles of:\\n<ul>\\n<li>Data minimization? (Is only strictly necessary personal information collected, used, stored, and transferred by the feature?)</li>\\n<li>Purpose specification? (Is the existence of the feature, its usage of the personal information and the reasons why it processes the personal information captured by the Privacy Policy?)</li>\\n<li>Use, retention and disclosure?&nbsp; (Does the feature use the personal information, store it and disclose it in ways which are compatible with the purpose(s) for which it is designed?)</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.2 Development Process</strong></h3>\\n<p>{{organization.name}} DevOps follows a streamlined branching strategy designed for continuous delivery. Secure coding practices are enforced using static analysis, dynamic analysis, and dependency scanning tools integrated within the CI/CD pipeline.</p>\\n<p><strong>3.2.1 Feature Development</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Lightweight Specifications:</strong> Features to be developed are described with brief user stories or issue descriptions focused on user outcomes. Technical specifications, if needed, should be concise.</li>\\n<li><strong>Feature Toggles:</strong> Incorporate feature toggles/flags to enable deployment of incomplete work to staging or production environments (behind a toggle) for early testing and feedback.</li>\\n<li><strong>Feature Branches:</strong> Feature branches should be short-lived and merged into <code>master</code> within a few days. During the development process, changes from master should be integrated into the feature branch on an ongoing basis.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.2.2 Pull Requests</strong></p>\\n<p>Pull Requests (PRs) are the primary mechanism for code review and integration in our continuous delivery environment. To ensure quality and timely integration, the following requirements apply to all pull requests:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Automated Reviews:</strong>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Code analysis tools (e.g., static code checkers)</li>\\n<li>Unit tests</li>\\n<li>Security scans (e.g., dependency scanning for vulnerabilities)</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li><strong>Successful execution of these automated checks is mandatory</strong> before a PR can be merged into the <code>master</code> branch. Results must be addressed within the PR.</li>\\n<li><strong>Asynchronous Review:</strong> While senior developer review remains valuable, the focus should be on code quality, architecture, and integration considerations. Leverage the automated test suite and linting tools to catch common errors.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.2.2.1 Additional Considerations:</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Reviewers should not be the same person who authored the PR.</li>\\n<li>Pull request comments should document any new dependencies introduced or database migration requirements.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.2.2.2 Post-Review Actions</strong></p>\\n<p>Once the pull request is reviewed, it can be:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Approved and merged into master:</strong> The reviewer comments on the PR indicating approval.</li>\\n<li><strong>Rejected with changes:</strong> The reviewer comments with necessary changes. After changes are made by the developer, the PR will be re-reviewed for approval.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>After a pull request is reviewed, approved, and merged, the associated feature branch may be deleted.</p>\\n<p><strong>3.2.2.3 Merge Strategy</strong></p>\\n<p>To maintain a clear and easy-to-follow code history, developers must follow the following guideliens for how pull requests are merged:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Fast-forward and Squash Merges Preferred:</strong> For clean and linear Git history, we recommend using fast-forward merges or squash merges whenever possible. These merge strategies minimize the number of commits in the <code>master</code> branch, making it easier to track code evolution.</li>\\n<li><strong>Branch Merges (With Caution):</strong> Branch merges should only be used in rare cases where preserving the individual commits in the feature branch is crucial. This could be for debugging purposes or if the feature branch has a complex history that needs to be maintained separately.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.2.2.3 Commit Message Formatting</strong></p>\\n<p>For \\\"final\\\" commit messages that will be included in the master branch history, developers shall follow the LKML guidelines for informative commit messages. These guidelines emphasize a short subject line describing the change followed by a more detailed body explaining the reasoning and potential impact. Please also observe the following best practices as outlined at&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://cbea.ms/git-commit/\\\">https://cbea.ms/git-commit/</a></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#separate\\\">Separate subject from body with a blank line</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#limit-50\\\">Limit the subject line to 50 characters</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#capitalize\\\">Capitalize the subject line</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#end\\\">Do not end the subject line with a period</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#imperative\\\">Use the imperative mood in the subject line</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#wrap-72\\\">Wrap the body at 72 characters</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#why-not-how\\\">Use the body to explain&nbsp;<em>what</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>why</em>&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;<em>how</em></a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.2.3 Releases</strong></p>\\n<p>To manage releases in a continuous deployment environment, the following steps shall be followed:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li><strong>Tag for Release:</strong> When code on the <code>master</code> branch is considered production-ready, a new release tag shall be created following semantic versioning principles (e.g., v1.2.0).</li>\\n<li><strong>Create Release:</strong> A new Release shall be drafted and linked to the created tag. The release shall include detailed notes outlining all relevant changes.</li>\\n<li><strong>Trigger Deployment:</strong> The CI/CD pipeline will be automatically executed upon the new release, handling the build, test, and deployment process to production.</li>\\n<li><strong>Monitor Post-Release:</strong> Production systems shall be closely monitored to quickly identify and address any issues that may arise after deployment.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><strong>3.2.4 Hotfixes</strong></p>\\n<p>When a critical bug is discovered in production, developers shall follow the following procedure for expedited hotfixes:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li><strong>Hotfix Branch:</strong> Create a hotfix branch directly off the <code>master</code> branch. Clearly name it to indicate its purpose (e.g., <code>hotfix/critical-security-issue</code>).</li>\\n<li><strong>Apply Fix:</strong> Implement the fix on the hotfix branch.</li>\\n<li><strong>Pull Request:</strong> Create a pull request to merge the hotfix into <code>master</code>. While standard reviews apply, prioritize urgency in this case.</li>\\n<li><strong>Automated Deployment:</strong> The CI/CD pipeline will automatically build, test, and deploy the hotfix to production once it's merged into <code>master</code>.</li>\\n<li><strong>Tag for Tracking:</strong> Although a full release isn't necessary, create a release tag on <code>master</code> to track the hotfix deployment.</li>\\n<li><strong>Regression Testing:</strong> Write a test case, if applicable, to prevent the bug from reappearing. Integrate this test into your automated test suite.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><strong>3.2.5 Branching Strategy Summary</strong></p>\\n<p>{{organization.name}}'s branching strategy promotes rapid releases and continuous deployment:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Master Branch:</strong> The <code>master</code> branch always reflects the latest, production-ready code.</li>\\n<li><strong>Feature Branches:</strong> Short-lived feature branches are created directly from <code>master</code>. Use clear naming conventions (e.g., <code>feature/new-widget</code>).</li>\\n<li><strong>Pull Requests:</strong> Once a feature is complete, create a pull request to merge back into <code>master</code>. Automated tests and code reviews are mandatory.</li>\\n<li><strong>Continuous Deployment:</strong> Approved and merged pull requests automatically trigger the CI/CD pipeline, which deploys changes to production.</li>\\n<li><strong>Hotfixes:</strong> If critical, hotfixes branch from <code>master</code>, follow a fast-track pull request process, and are immediately deployed upon merging.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Key Principles</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Small, Frequent Changes:</strong> Encourages smaller, well-tested features that can be rapidly deployed.</li>\\n<li><strong>Automation:</strong> CI/CD pipeline handles testing, build, and deployment for every change to <code>master</code>.</li>\\n<li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Robust monitoring and logging are essential for quick detection and rollback if needed.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.3 Service Vulnerability Reviews</strong></h3>\\n<p>Products and services released by {{organization.name}} require regular reviews for vulnerabilities and attacks.&nbsp;</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>External scan and penetration tests will be performed annually.</li>\\n<li>A severity rating system and process shall be established to prioritize application vulnerabilities for root cause and ensure remediation.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.4 Data Processing Input Validation</strong></h3>\\n<p>All data processing inputs are defined, including the source and criteria for processing. All data processed by the {{organization.name}} application is collected directly by the application.</p>\\n<p>All data processing tasks include a data validation step confirming the integrity of the data to be processed. Data integrity is enforced at the application level.</p>\\n<p>Input fields in the {{organization.name}} application are validated on both the client side and the server side for proper formatting, data type and expected values. The definitive source for data validation is on the trusted system (server). Invalid data will be rejected by the server.</p>\\n<p>All data inputs must be validated for:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Character encoding.</li>\\n<li>Acceptable header/cookie values.</li>\\n<li>Expected data types/ranges/lengths/valid values.</li>\\n<li>Allowed characters.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>User supplied data must never be passed to any dynamic execution function.</p>\\n<h4><strong>3.4.1 Data Processing Schedules</strong></h4>\\n<p>Data processing schedules are defined within the {{organization.name}} application. The results of the processing tasks should be logged and reviewed periodically. Errors and/or exceptions encountered in the processing task generate a detailed exception email that is sent to the DevOps team for remediation.</p>\\n<h3><strong>3.5 Authentication and Password Management</strong></h3>\\n<p>{{organization.name}} adheres to the following practices for secure authentication and management of user passwords:</p>\\n<p><strong>3.5.1 General Authentication</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Authentication is mandatory for all resources and systems within the organization's infrastructure, excluding those explicitly designated as public.</li>\\n<li>Authentication mechanisms shall be enforced by trusted systems designed to fail securely in the event of errors or unauthorized attempts.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.5.2 Password Storage</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>All passwords must be stored using a robust one-way cryptographic hash function specifically designed for password hashing, such as Argon2id, scrypt, or bcrypt.</li>\\n<li>Passwords shall be salted with a unique, randomly generated salt per user prior to hashing.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.5.3 Password Complexity</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Where possible, user passwords must meet the following complexity requirements:\\n<ul>\\n<li>Minimum length of 12 characters.</li>\\n<li>Mixture of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.</li>\\n<li>Passwords must not be found in lists of commonly used, leaked, or easily guessed passwords.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.5.4 Account Lockout</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>User accounts shall be temporarily disabled after a predefined number of consecutive failed login attempts (e.g., 5 attempts within a 15-minute timeframe).</li>\\n<li>Lockout durations shall escalate with subsequent failed attempts.</li>\\n<li>A secure mechanism for users to self-reset or unlock their accounts shall be provided.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.5.5 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) should be available for all users and all access types, and must be required for&nbsp;administrative access and any remote access to the organization's systems.</li>\\n<li>Preferred MFA methods include hardware tokens or authenticator applications. SMS-based MFA should be used only as a last resort.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.5.6 Session Management</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>User sessions shall expire after a period of inactivity (e.g., 30 minutes of inactivity)</li>\\n<li>Absolute session timeouts shall be enforced (e.g., maximum session length of 8 hours)</li>\\n<li>Sensitive operations shall require session re-authentication.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.5.7 Additional Security Measures</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>{{organization.name}} shall implement a centralized identity management system (e.g., LDAP, Active Directory, Single Sign-On solution) for improved user management and access control.</li>\\n<li><strong>3.5.7.1</strong> Access to systems and resources shall be governed by a role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC) framework.</li>\\n<li><strong>3.5.7.2</strong> Regular password audits shall be performed to identify weak, reused, or potentially compromised passwords.</li>\\n<li><strong>3.5.7.3</strong> A breach notification procedure shall be established to inform relevant users and potentially regulatory bodies in the event of a data breach that compromises user credentials.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.6 Access Management</strong></p>\\n<p>{{organization.name}} enforces the following access management principles to protect systems and data:</p>\\n<p><strong>3.6.1 Access Token Handling</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Access tokens shall be generated exclusively on trusted systems with proven security measures.</li>\\n<li>Access token identifiers must use cryptographically secure random number generators (CSPRNG) to ensure unpredictability.</li>\\n<li>Token expiration times shall be strictly enforced, striking a balance between security and user experience. Shorter expirations are preferred, aligned with risk tolerance.</li>\\n<li>Upon successful re-authentication, a new access token must be generated, invalidating the previous token.</li>\\n<li>Access tokens shall never be transmitted over insecure channels (e.g., unencrypted HTTP). Transport Layer Security (TLS) is mandatory.</li>\\n<li>User logout functionality must securely revoke all active access tokens associated with that user's session.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.6.2 Secure Access Control</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Access to all resources shall be governed by a principle of least privilege.</li>\\n<li>Robust access control mechanisms (RBAC or ABAC) shall be implemented and centrally managed.</li>\\n<li>All API requests, without exception, must undergo access control list (ACL) verification. ACLs shall consider both user permissions and relevant organizational context.</li>\\n<li>Access control logic shall be designed with a \\\"fail-closed\\\" approach, ensuring that unauthorized access attempts are denied by default.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.6.3 Production Deployment Safeguards</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>The production deployment branch (or branches) must be protected with strict access controls.</li>\\n<li>Changes to the production branch shall require mandatory code reviews and automated testing before deployment.</li>\\n<li>Direct, unreviewed pushes to the production branch shall be prohibited.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.6.4 Password Management</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Hardcoding passwords within scripts, configuration files, or custom source code is strictly forbidden.</li>\\n<li>Secure mechanisms such as password vaults or environment variable-based secrets management shall be used for handling sensitive credentials.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.6.5 Additional Considerations</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Zero Trust:</strong> Explore the implementation of Zero Trust principles to minimize implicit trust assumptions within the network perimeter.</li>\\n<li><strong>API Security:</strong> Employ comprehensive API security best practices, including input validation, rate limiting, and robust logging and monitoring.</li>\\n<li><strong>Regular Audits:</strong> Conduct regular audits of access permissions, user roles, and privileged accounts, ensuring alignment with the least privilege principle.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.7 Error Handling, Logging, and Observability</strong></h3>\\n<p>{{organization.name}} implements robust error handling, comprehensive logging, and integrated observability practices to safeguard sensitive information, facilitate rapid troubleshooting, and support incident response. We prioritize the use of open standards for instrumentation and data collection:</p>\\n<p><strong>3.7.1 Error Handling</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>User-Facing Errors:</strong> Error messages displayed to users must be generic and avoid revealing any internal system details or sensitive data that could be exploited by attackers.</li>\\n<li><strong>Sanitization:</strong> Log files and any error output must be sanitized to ensure they never contain passwords, API keys, session tokens, or other sensitive credentials.</li>\\n<li><strong>Production vs. Non-Production:</strong> Detailed error messages with stack traces may be exposed in development and testing environments, but never in production.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.7.2 Logging, Observability, and OpenTelemetry</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Centralized Logging:</strong> Logs from all systems shall be aggregated into a centralized log management system, ideally one integrated into a broader observability platform.</li>\\n<li><strong>Logging Levels:</strong> Employ a structured logging scheme with clear severity levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL).</li>\\n<li><strong>OpenTelemetry Instrumentation:</strong> Utilize OpenTelemetry (OTel) for instrumenting applications and infrastructure, aiming to collect logs, metrics, and traces.</li>\\n<li><strong>Essential Log Data:</strong> Log entries shall include, at a minimum:\\n<ul>\\n<li>Timestamp with timezone</li>\\n<li>System or component identifier</li>\\n<li>User identifier (if relevant)</li>\\n<li>Event description</li>\\n<li>Severity level</li>\\n<li>IP address or source identifier</li>\\n<li><strong>OpenTelemetry Trace IDs and Span IDs:</strong> For distributed tracing and correlation</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Access to log files and the observability platform must be restricted to authorized personnel, with role-based permissions enforced.</li>\\n<li><strong>Retention and Rotation:</strong> Define a log retention policy aligned with security, operational, and potential compliance requirements.

Disable legacy cipher suites known to be vulnerable.</li>\\n<li>Regularly review and update supported cipher suites as new vulnerabilities emerge or standards evolve.</li>\\n<li>Resources like Mozilla's SSL Configuration Generator can aid in selecting secure TLS configurations.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.9.3 Certificate Management</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Use valid, trusted certificates issued by recognized Certificate Authorities (CAs) for all TLS connections.</li>\\n<li>Employ certificate pinning (with caution) or mechanisms like Certificate Transparency Logs for added verification.</li>\\n<li>Implement robust certificate lifecycle management, including timely renewals and revocation processes.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.9.4 Fail Secure</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Never allow fallback to plaintext communication if a TLS connection fails. Systems must always negotiate a secure, encrypted connection according to the configured cipher suites.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.9.5 Additional Considerations</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Web Applications:</strong>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Enforce the use of HTTPS for all web traffic. Use HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) headers to prevent downgrade attacks.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li><strong>Email:</strong>\\n<ul>\\n<li>For sensitive email communications, consider email encryption solutions such as S/MIME or PGP. Be aware of the complexities of email key management.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li><strong>API Endpoints:</strong>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms on external APIs and enforce the strict use of TLS.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Cross-Reference:</strong> This policy aligns with and extends guidelines set forth in the Key Management and Cryptography Policy.</p>\\n<h2><strong>4.0 Customer Notification</strong></h2>\\n<p>As currently available products and services are regularly assessed and reviewed, {{organization.name}} will notify the designated customer contacts within 24 hours if a high-risk vulnerability is found. {{organization.name}} will provide a plan to address the issue and a timeline for when the software or service will have a solution available.

In the event that a change does not perform as expected or causes issues to one or more areas of the production environment, the attendees of the change meeting will determine if the change should be removed and the production environment returned to its prior stable state.</p>\\n<h3><strong>3.4 Denials</strong></h3>\\n<p>The Business Owner or Change Advisory Board (CAB) or their designee may deny a scheduled or unscheduled change for reasons including, but not limited to:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Inadequate change planning or unit testing</li>\\n<li>Lack of stakeholder acceptance (where applicable)</li>\\n<li>System integration or interoperability concerns</li>\\n<li>Missing or deficient roll-back plans</li>\\n<li>Security implications and risks</li>\\n<li>Timing of the change negatively impacts key business processes</li>\\n<li>Timeframes do not align with resource scheduling (e.g., late-night, weekends, holidays or special events)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.5 Emergency Changes</strong></h3>\\n<p>Changes that can not follow the normal process because of their urgency (such as service outages) shall be considered emergency changes because they require immediate attention and must be implemented quickly to avoid disruption.</p>\\n<p>Approvals shall be obtained for such changes in the form of a discussion with a relevant service manager. Such changes shall be assessed and formally approved retrospectively. In addition, such changes shall be discussed during the periodic Business Owner or CAB meetings for analysis of lessons learned, root cause, impact and status.</p>\\n<h3><strong>3.6 Standard Changes and Patching</strong></h3>\\n<p>Standard changes (also called &ldquo;routine changes&rdquo;) tend to be pre-authorized changes that are considered to have little to no risk associated with them. These changes (for example, applying security patches) are already pre-approved by IT Management, so they can be executed without following the change management approval workflow.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>All systems shall be patched and updated on a documented, regular and timely schedule. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is recommended to be used to aid in setting patching guidelines.</p>\\n<p>The organization must identify systems affected by announced software or firmware flaws, including potential vulnerabilities resulting from these flaws. Security-relevant patches, service packs, hotfixes and anti-virus signatures should be reported to designated personnel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>During security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, and system error handling, flaws discovered should be addressed.</p>\",\"version_num\":3,\"master_version_num\":11,\"created\":\"2021-12-17T14:42:00.780588Z\",\"updated\":\"2024-05-04T18:35:18.853475Z\",\"published_by_id\":99999,\"published_date\":\"2024-05-04T18:35:18.841391Z\",\"review_date\":null,\"status\":\"published\",\"no_rfp_usage\":false,\"category\":\"Security Operations\",\"master_policy_id\":53,\"org_id\":12345,\"id\":94626,\"__entity_type__\":\"policy\",\"__permissions__\":[\"policy:export\",\"policy:manage_events\",\"policy:manage_acl\",\"policy:assign\",\"policy:comment\",\"policy:create_version\",\"policy:add_org_evidence\",\"policy:deprecate\",\"policy:manage_groups\",\"policy:unpublish\",\"policy:set_review_date\",\"policy:manage_versions\",\"policy:set_reviewer\",\"policy:delete\",\"policy:manage_tags\",\"policy:reset_training\",\"policy:view_awareness\",\"policy:edit\",\"policy:view_details\",\"policy:manage_settings\",\"policy:create_event\",\"policy:upgrade\",\"policy:export_to_evidence\",\"policy:mark_not_applicable\"],\"tags\":[],\"assignees\":[{\"first_name\":\"Test\",\"last_name\":\"User\",\"has_reviewed_name\":true,\"is_owner\":true,\"created\":\"2022-01-09T21:25:23.859312Z\",\"updated\":\"2025-01-09T05:00:00.600811Z\",\"suspended\":false,\"training_completed\":null,\"training_expiry_date\":\"2026-01-09\",\"display_name\":\"Test User\",\"short_display_name\":\"TU\",\"pendo_enabled\":true,\"org_id\":12345,\"org\":12345,\"user_id\":99999,\"attachment_id\":null,\"org_role_id\":3,\"id\":888888,\"__entity_type__\":\"organization_member\",\"attachment\":null,\"user\":{\"id\":888888,\"__entity_role__\":null,\"__entity_type__\":\"user\",\"__permissions__\":[\"user:add_auth_factor\",\"user:reset_password\",\"user:set_password\",\"user:generate_backup_codes\",\"user:request_email_change\"],\"email\":\"test@example.com\",\"last_login\":\"2025-07-03T19:44:35.624768Z\",\"status\":\"active\",\"is_locked_out\":null,\"locked_out_until\":null}}],\"current_version_status\":null,\"read_time\":6,\"reviewers\":[]},{\"name\":\"Corporate Ethics\",\"summary\":\"The organization values ethics, trust and integrity throughout its business practices.\",\"details\":\"<h1 style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><strong>{{organization.name}} Corporate Ethics Policy</strong></h1>\\n<h2><strong>1.

The goal of {{organization.name}} software practices is to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information resources in order to enable secure and successful business operations.</p>\\n<h2><strong>2.0 Scope</strong></h2>\\n<p>This policy covers all development activities carried out by the DevOps team during the design, implementation and maintenance of {{organization.name}} products and services. {{organization.name}} follows a branching strategy workflow for source control and uses the principles outlined in the <a href=\\\"https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/OWASP_SCP_Quick_Reference_Guide_v2.pdf\\\">OWASP Secure Coding Practices</a> to train the DevOps team and defend against the <a href=\\\"https://owasp.org/Top10/\\\">OWASP Top 10</a> security vulnerabilities.</p>\\n<h2><strong>3.0 Policy</strong></h2>\\n<h3><strong>3.1 Design Process</strong></h3>\\n<p>{{organization.name}} DevOps team will consider the security implications of any feature development and/or enhancement to ensure the security and stability of {{organization.name}}&rsquo;s application. Things to consider are:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>How can this feature be misused?</li>\\n<li>Does this feature cause unnecessary data exposure?</li>\\n<li>Does this feature expose an attack vector?</li>\\n<li>Are the data sources used by the feature trusted or untrusted?</li>\\n<li>Does the feature follow the privacy principles of:\\n<ul>\\n<li>Data minimization? (Is only strictly necessary personal information collected, used, stored, and transferred by the feature?)</li>\\n<li>Purpose specification? (Is the existence of the feature, its usage of the personal information and the reasons why it processes the personal information captured by the Privacy Policy?)</li>\\n<li>Use, retention and disclosure?&nbsp; (Does the feature use the personal information, store it and disclose it in ways which are compatible with the purpose(s) for which it is designed?)</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.2 Development Process</strong></h3>\\n<p>{{organization.name}} DevOps follows a streamlined branching strategy designed for continuous delivery. Secure coding practices are enforced using static analysis, dynamic analysis, and dependency scanning tools integrated within the CI/CD pipeline.</p>\\n<p><strong>3.2.1 Feature Development</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Lightweight Specifications:</strong> Features to be developed are described with brief user stories or issue descriptions focused on user outcomes. Technical specifications, if needed, should be concise.</li>\\n<li><strong>Feature Toggles:</strong> Incorporate feature toggles/flags to enable deployment of incomplete work to staging or production environments (behind a toggle) for early testing and feedback.</li>\\n<li><strong>Feature Branches:</strong> Feature branches should be short-lived and merged into <code>master</code> within a few days. During the development process, changes from master should be integrated into the feature branch on an ongoing basis.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.2.2 Pull Requests</strong></p>\\n<p>Pull Requests (PRs) are the primary mechanism for code review and integration in our continuous delivery environment. To ensure quality and timely integration, the following requirements apply to all pull requests:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Automated Reviews:</strong>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Code analysis tools (e.g., static code checkers)</li>\\n<li>Unit tests</li>\\n<li>Security scans (e.g., dependency scanning for vulnerabilities)</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li><strong>Successful execution of these automated checks is mandatory</strong> before a PR can be merged into the <code>master</code> branch. Results must be addressed within the PR.</li>\\n<li><strong>Asynchronous Review:</strong> While senior developer review remains valuable, the focus should be on code quality, architecture, and integration considerations. Leverage the automated test suite and linting tools to catch common errors.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.2.2.1 Additional Considerations:</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Reviewers should not be the same person who authored the PR.</li>\\n<li>Pull request comments should document any new dependencies introduced or database migration requirements.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.2.2.2 Post-Review Actions</strong></p>\\n<p>Once the pull request is reviewed, it can be:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Approved and merged into master:</strong> The reviewer comments on the PR indicating approval.</li>\\n<li><strong>Rejected with changes:</strong> The reviewer comments with necessary changes. After changes are made by the developer, the PR will be re-reviewed for approval.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>After a pull request is reviewed, approved, and merged, the associated feature branch may be deleted.</p>\\n<p><strong>3.2.2.3 Merge Strategy</strong></p>\\n<p>To maintain a clear and easy-to-follow code history, developers must follow the following guideliens for how pull requests are merged:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Fast-forward and Squash Merges Preferred:</strong> For clean and linear Git history, we recommend using fast-forward merges or squash merges whenever possible. These merge strategies minimize the number of commits in the <code>master</code> branch, making it easier to track code evolution.</li>\\n<li><strong>Branch Merges (With Caution):</strong> Branch merges should only be used in rare cases where preserving the individual commits in the feature branch is crucial. This could be for debugging purposes or if the feature branch has a complex history that needs to be maintained separately.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.2.2.3 Commit Message Formatting</strong></p>\\n<p>For \\\"final\\\" commit messages that will be included in the master branch history, developers shall follow the LKML guidelines for informative commit messages. These guidelines emphasize a short subject line describing the change followed by a more detailed body explaining the reasoning and potential impact. Please also observe the following best practices as outlined at&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://cbea.ms/git-commit/\\\">https://cbea.ms/git-commit/</a></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#separate\\\">Separate subject from body with a blank line</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#limit-50\\\">Limit the subject line to 50 characters</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#capitalize\\\">Capitalize the subject line</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#end\\\">Do not end the subject line with a period</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#imperative\\\">Use the imperative mood in the subject line</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#wrap-72\\\">Wrap the body at 72 characters</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#why-not-how\\\">Use the body to explain&nbsp;<em>what</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>why</em>&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;<em>how</em></a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.2.3 Releases</strong></p>\\n<p>To manage releases in a continuous deployment environment, the following steps shall be followed:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li><strong>Tag for Release:</strong> When code on the <code>master</code> branch is considered production-ready, a new release tag shall be created following semantic versioning principles (e.g., v1.2.0).</li>\\n<li><strong>Create Release:</strong> A new Release shall be drafted and linked to the created tag. The release shall include detailed notes outlining all relevant changes.</li>\\n<li><strong>Trigger Deployment:</strong> The CI/CD pipeline will be automatically executed upon the new release, handling the build, test, and deployment process to production.</li>\\n<li><strong>Monitor Post-Release:</strong> Production systems shall be closely monitored to quickly identify and address any issues that may arise after deployment.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><strong>3.2.4 Hotfixes</strong></p>\\n<p>When a critical bug is discovered in production, developers shall follow the following procedure for expedited hotfixes:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li><strong>Hotfix Branch:</strong> Create a hotfix branch directly off the <code>master</code> branch. Clearly name it to indicate its purpose (e.g., <code>hotfix/critical-security-issue</code>).</li>\\n<li><strong>Apply Fix:</strong> Implement the fix on the hotfix branch.</li>\\n<li><strong>Pull Request:</strong> Create a pull request to merge the hotfix into <code>master</code>. While standard reviews apply, prioritize urgency in this case.</li>\\n<li><strong>Automated Deployment:</strong> The CI/CD pipeline will automatically build, test, and deploy the hotfix to production once it's merged into <code>master</code>.</li>\\n<li><strong>Tag for Tracking:</strong> Although a full release isn't necessary, create a release tag on <code>master</code> to track the hotfix deployment.</li>\\n<li><strong>Regression Testing:</strong> Write a test case, if applicable, to prevent the bug from reappearing. Integrate this test into your automated test suite.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><strong>3.2.5 Branching Strategy Summary</strong></p>\\n<p>{{organization.name}}'s branching strategy promotes rapid releases and continuous deployment:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Master Branch:</strong> The <code>master</code> branch always reflects the latest, production-ready code.</li>\\n<li><strong>Feature Branches:</strong> Short-lived feature branches are created directly from <code>master</code>. Use clear naming conventions (e.g., <code>feature/new-widget</code>).</li>\\n<li><strong>Pull Requests:</strong> Once a feature is complete, create a pull request to merge back into <code>master</code>. Automated tests and code reviews are mandatory.</li>\\n<li><strong>Continuous Deployment:</strong> Approved and merged pull requests automatically trigger the CI/CD pipeline, which deploys changes to production.</li>\\n<li><strong>Hotfixes:</strong> If critical, hotfixes branch from <code>master</code>, follow a fast-track pull request process, and are immediately deployed upon merging.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Key Principles</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Small, Frequent Changes:</strong> Encourages smaller, well-tested features that can be rapidly deployed.</li>\\n<li><strong>Automation:</strong> CI/CD pipeline handles testing, build, and deployment for every change to <code>master</code>.</li>\\n<li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Robust monitoring and logging are essential for quick detection and rollback if needed.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.3 Service Vulnerability Reviews</strong></h3>\\n<p>Products and services released by {{organization.name}} require regular reviews for vulnerabilities and attacks.&nbsp;</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>External scan and penetration tests will be performed annually.</li>\\n<li>A severity rating system and process shall be established to prioritize application vulnerabilities for root cause and ensure remediation.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.4 Data Processing Input Validation</strong></h3>\\n<p>All data processing inputs are defined, including the source and criteria for processing. All data processed by the {{organization.name}} application is collected directly by the application.</p>\\n<p>All data processing tasks include a data validation step confirming the integrity of the data to be processed. Data integrity is enforced at the application level.</p>\\n<p>Input fields in the {{organization.name}} application are validated on both the client side and the server side for proper formatting, data type and expected values. The definitive source for data validation is on the trusted system (server). Invalid data will be rejected by the server.</p>\\n<p>All data inputs must be validated for:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Character encoding.</li>\\n<li>Acceptable header/cookie values.</li>\\n<li>Expected data types/ranges/lengths/valid values.</li>\\n<li>Allowed characters.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>User supplied data must never be passed to any dynamic execution function.</p>\\n<h4><strong>3.4.1 Data Processing Schedules</strong></h4>\\n<p>Data processing schedules are defined within the {{organization.name}} application. The results of the processing tasks should be logged and reviewed periodically. Errors and/or exceptions encountered in the processing task generate a detailed exception email that is sent to the DevOps team for remediation.</p>\\n<h3><strong>3.5 Authentication and Password Management</strong></h3>\\n<p>{{organization.name}} adheres to the following practices for secure authentication and management of user passwords:</p>\\n<p><strong>3.5.1 General Authentication</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Authentication is mandatory for all resources and systems within the organization's infrastructure, excluding those explicitly designated as public.</li>\\n<li>Authentication mechanisms shall be enforced by trusted systems designed to fail securely in the event of errors or unauthorized attempts.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.5.2 Password Storage</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>All passwords must be stored using a robust one-way cryptographic hash function specifically designed for password hashing, such as Argon2id, scrypt, or bcrypt.</li>\\n<li>Passwords shall be salted with a unique, randomly generated salt per user prior to hashing.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.5.3 Password Complexity</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Where possible, user passwords must meet the following complexity requirements:\\n<ul>\\n<li>Minimum length of 12 characters.</li>\\n<li>Mixture of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.</li>\\n<li>Passwords must not be found in lists of commonly used, leaked, or easily guessed passwords.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.5.4 Account Lockout</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>User accounts shall be temporarily disabled after a predefined number of consecutive failed login attempts (e.g., 5 attempts within a 15-minute timeframe).</li>\\n<li>Lockout durations shall escalate with subsequent failed attempts.</li>\\n<li>A secure mechanism for users to self-reset or unlock their accounts shall be provided.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.5.5 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) should be available for all users and all access types, and must be required for&nbsp;administrative access and any remote access to the organization's systems.</li>\\n<li>Preferred MFA methods include hardware tokens or authenticator applications. SMS-based MFA should be used only as a last resort.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.5.6 Session Management</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>User sessions shall expire after a period of inactivity (e.g., 30 minutes of inactivity)</li>\\n<li>Absolute session timeouts shall be enforced (e.g., maximum session length of 8 hours)</li>\\n<li>Sensitive operations shall require session re-authentication.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.5.7 Additional Security Measures</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>{{organization.name}} shall implement a centralized identity management system (e.g., LDAP, Active Directory, Single Sign-On solution) for improved user management and access control.</li>\\n<li><strong>3.5.7.1</strong> Access to systems and resources shall be governed by a role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC) framework.</li>\\n<li><strong>3.5.7.2</strong> Regular password audits shall be performed to identify weak, reused, or potentially compromised passwords.</li>\\n<li><strong>3.5.7.3</strong> A breach notification procedure shall be established to inform relevant users and potentially regulatory bodies in the event of a data breach that compromises user credentials.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.6 Access Management</strong></p>\\n<p>{{organization.name}} enforces the following access management principles to protect systems and data:</p>\\n<p><strong>3.6.1 Access Token Handling</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Access tokens shall be generated exclusively on trusted systems with proven security measures.</li>\\n<li>Access token identifiers must use cryptographically secure random number generators (CSPRNG) to ensure unpredictability.</li>\\n<li>Token expiration times shall be strictly enforced, striking a balance between security and user experience. Shorter expirations are preferred, aligned with risk tolerance.</li>\\n<li>Upon successful re-authentication, a new access token must be generated, invalidating the previous token.</li>\\n<li>Access tokens shall never be transmitted over insecure channels (e.g., unencrypted HTTP). Transport Layer Security (TLS) is mandatory.</li>\\n<li>User logout functionality must securely revoke all active access tokens associated with that user's session.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.6.2 Secure Access Control</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Access to all resources shall be governed by a principle of least privilege.</li>\\n<li>Robust access control mechanisms (RBAC or ABAC) shall be implemented and centrally managed.</li>\\n<li>All API requests, without exception, must undergo access control list (ACL) verification. ACLs shall consider both user permissions and relevant organizational context.</li>\\n<li>Access control logic shall be designed with a \\\"fail-closed\\\" approach, ensuring that unauthorized access attempts are denied by default.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.6.3 Production Deployment Safeguards</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>The production deployment branch (or branches) must be protected with strict access controls.</li>\\n<li>Changes to the production branch shall require mandatory code reviews and automated testing before deployment.</li>\\n<li>Direct, unreviewed pushes to the production branch shall be prohibited.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.6.4 Password Management</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Hardcoding passwords within scripts, configuration files, or custom source code is strictly forbidden.</li>\\n<li>Secure mechanisms such as password vaults or environment variable-based secrets management shall be used for handling sensitive credentials.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.6.5 Additional Considerations</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Zero Trust:</strong> Explore the implementation of Zero Trust principles to minimize implicit trust assumptions within the network perimeter.</li>\\n<li><strong>API Security:</strong> Employ comprehensive API security best practices, including input validation, rate limiting, and robust logging and monitoring.</li>\\n<li><strong>Regular Audits:</strong> Conduct regular audits of access permissions, user roles, and privileged accounts, ensuring alignment with the least privilege principle.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.7 Error Handling, Logging, and Observability</strong></h3>\\n<p>{{organization.name}} implements robust error handling, comprehensive logging, and integrated observability practices to safeguard sensitive information, facilitate rapid troubleshooting, and support incident response. We prioritize the use of open standards for instrumentation and data collection:</p>\\n<p><strong>3.7.1 Error Handling</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>User-Facing Errors:</strong> Error messages displayed to users must be generic and avoid revealing any internal system details or sensitive data that could be exploited by attackers.</li>\\n<li><strong>Sanitization:</strong> Log files and any error output must be sanitized to ensure they never contain passwords, API keys, session tokens, or other sensitive credentials.</li>\\n<li><strong>Production vs. Non-Production:</strong> Detailed error messages with stack traces may be exposed in development and testing environments, but never in production.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.7.2 Logging, Observability, and OpenTelemetry</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Centralized Logging:</strong> Logs from all systems shall be aggregated into a centralized log management system, ideally one integrated into a broader observability platform.</li>\\n<li><strong>Logging Levels:</strong> Employ a structured logging scheme with clear severity levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL).</li>\\n<li><strong>OpenTelemetry Instrumentation:</strong> Utilize OpenTelemetry (OTel) for instrumenting applications and infrastructure, aiming to collect logs, metrics, and traces.</li>\\n<li><strong>Essential Log Data:</strong> Log entries shall include, at a minimum:\\n<ul>\\n<li>Timestamp with timezone</li>\\n<li>System or component identifier</li>\\n<li>User identifier (if relevant)</li>\\n<li>Event description</li>\\n<li>Severity level</li>\\n<li>IP address or source identifier</li>\\n<li><strong>OpenTelemetry Trace IDs and Span IDs:</strong> For distributed tracing and correlation</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Access to log files and the observability platform must be restricted to authorized personnel, with role-based permissions enforced.</li>\\n<li><strong>Retention and Rotation:</strong> Define a log retention policy aligned with security, operational, and potential compliance requirements. Implement log rotation procedures.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.7.3 Additional Considerations</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Input Validation:</strong> Log data from user input should be treated as untrusted and subject to input validation to prevent log injection attacks.</li>\\n<li><strong>Audit Logging:</strong> Maintain separate audit logs focused on security-related events (logins, privilege changes, data access, etc.), ensuring these integrate with observability systems.</li>\\n<li><strong>Log Analysis, Alerting, and Tracing:</strong>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Configure automated alerting for critical events or anomalous activity.</li>\\n<li>Leverage observability tools to visually correlate OTel data, allowing for rapid debugging across distributed environments.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.8 Data Protection</strong></h3>\\n<p>{{organization.name}} is committed to safeguarding data throughout its lifecycle. The following principles form the foundation of our data protection practices:</p>\\n<p><strong>3.8.1 Principle of Least Privilege</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Access to data shall be granted on a need-to-know basis, with permissions strictly aligned with job responsibilities.</li>\\n<li>Role-based or attribute-based access control (RBAC or ABAC) models shall be used to enforce granular permissions.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.8.2 Data Minimization</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Collection and storage of sensitive data shall be limited to what is strictly necessary to fulfill business purposes.</li>\\n<li>Temporary data copies must be securely erased immediately after their intended use.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.8.3 Credential Protection</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Passwords and other sensitive credentials shall never be stored in plaintext.</strong> Use robust, modern password hashing algorithms specifically designed for the task (e.g., Argon2id, scrypt, bcrypt).</li>\\n<li>Each password or credential must utilize a unique, cryptographically random salt.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.8.4 Data in Transit</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>All data transmission, internally and externally, must occur over secure, encrypted channels using Transport Layer Security (TLS).</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.8.5 Web Application Security</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Prevent Data Exposure:</strong> Client-side code shall be stripped of application comments that could reveal sensitive information.</li>\\n<li><strong>Avoid GET Parameters:</strong> Never transmit sensitive data within GET request parameters.</li>\\n<li><strong>Manage Caching:</strong> Properly configure response headers to disable caching on any pages that display or process sensitive information.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.8.6 Data in Non-Production Environments</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>The use of production data in non-production environments (e.g., development or testing) is strongly discouraged.</li>\\n<li>If absolutely necessary, production data must be:\\n<ul>\\n<li>Masked or de-identified to protect any personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive data.</li>\\n<li>Access restricted exclusively to authorized personnel.</li>\\n<li>Usage subject to documented approvals and justifications.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.9 Communication Security</strong></h3>\\n<p>{{organization.name}} is committed to safeguarding data in transit. The following principles guide our communication security practices:</p>\\n<p><strong>3.9.1 Mandatory Encryption</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>All communication of sensitive data, both internally and externally, must occur exclusively over encrypted channels.</li>\\n<li>Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the mandated encryption protocol. Use version 1.2 or higher, with a strong focus on the most recent stable versions (e.g., TLS 1.3).</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.9.2 Cipher Suite Configuration</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Only modern, strong cipher suites shall be supported. Disable legacy cipher suites known to be vulnerable.</li>\\n<li>Regularly review and update supported cipher suites as new vulnerabilities emerge or standards evolve.</li>\\n<li>Resources like Mozilla's SSL Configuration Generator can aid in selecting secure TLS configurations.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.9.3 Certificate Management</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Use valid, trusted certificates issued by recognized Certificate Authorities (CAs) for all TLS connections.</li>\\n<li>Employ certificate pinning (with caution) or mechanisms like Certificate Transparency Logs for added verification.</li>\\n<li>Implement robust certificate lifecycle management, including timely renewals and revocation processes.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.9.4 Fail Secure</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Never allow fallback to plaintext communication if a TLS connection fails. Systems must always negotiate a secure, encrypted connection according to the configured cipher suites.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.9.5 Additional Considerations</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Web Applications:</strong>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Enforce the use of HTTPS for all web traffic. Use HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) headers to prevent downgrade attacks.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li><strong>Email:</strong>\\n<ul>\\n<li>For sensitive email communications, consider email encryption solutions such as S/MIME or PGP. Be aware of the complexities of email key management.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li><strong>API Endpoints:</strong>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms on external APIs and enforce the strict use of TLS.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Cross-Reference:</strong> This policy aligns with and extends guidelines set forth in the Key Management and Cryptography Policy.</p>\\n<h2><strong>4.0 Customer Notification</strong></h2>\\n<p>As currently available products and services are regularly assessed and reviewed, {{organization.name}} will notify the designated customer contacts within 24 hours if a high-risk vulnerability is found. {{organization.name}} will provide a plan to address the issue and a timeline for when the software or service will have a solution available.

In the event that a change does not perform as expected or causes issues to one or more areas of the production environment, the attendees of the change meeting will determine if the change should be removed and the production environment returned to its prior stable state.</p>\\n<h3><strong>3.4 Denials</strong></h3>\\n<p>The Business Owner or Change Advisory Board (CAB) or their designee may deny a scheduled or unscheduled change for reasons including, but not limited to:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Inadequate change planning or unit testing</li>\\n<li>Lack of stakeholder acceptance (where applicable)</li>\\n<li>System integration or interoperability concerns</li>\\n<li>Missing or deficient roll-back plans</li>\\n<li>Security implications and risks</li>\\n<li>Timing of the change negatively impacts key business processes</li>\\n<li>Timeframes do not align with resource scheduling (e.g., late-night, weekends, holidays or special events)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.5 Emergency Changes</strong></h3>\\n<p>Changes that can not follow the normal process because of their urgency (such as service outages) shall be considered emergency changes because they require immediate attention and must be implemented quickly to avoid disruption.</p>\\n<p>Approvals shall be obtained for such changes in the form of a discussion with a relevant service manager. Such changes shall be assessed and formally approved retrospectively. In addition, such changes shall be discussed during the periodic Business Owner or CAB meetings for analysis of lessons learned, root cause, impact and status.</p>\\n<h3><strong>3.6 Standard Changes and Patching</strong></h3>\\n<p>Standard changes (also called &ldquo;routine changes&rdquo;) tend to be pre-authorized changes that are considered to have little to no risk associated with them. These changes (for example, applying security patches) are already pre-approved by IT Management, so they can be executed without following the change management approval workflow.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>All systems shall be patched and updated on a documented, regular and timely schedule. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is recommended to be used to aid in setting patching guidelines.</p>\\n<p>The organization must identify systems affected by announced software or firmware flaws, including potential vulnerabilities resulting from these flaws.

Technical specifications, if needed, should be concise.</li>\\n<li><strong>Feature Toggles:</strong> Incorporate feature toggles/flags to enable deployment of incomplete work to staging or production environments (behind a toggle) for early testing and feedback.</li>\\n<li><strong>Feature Branches:</strong> Feature branches should be short-lived and merged into <code>master</code> within a few days. During the development process, changes from master should be integrated into the feature branch on an ongoing basis.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.2.2 Pull Requests</strong></p>\\n<p>Pull Requests (PRs) are the primary mechanism for code review and integration in our continuous delivery environment. To ensure quality and timely integration, the following requirements apply to all pull requests:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Automated Reviews:</strong>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Code analysis tools (e.g., static code checkers)</li>\\n<li>Unit tests</li>\\n<li>Security scans (e.g., dependency scanning for vulnerabilities)</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li><strong>Successful execution of these automated checks is mandatory</strong> before a PR can be merged into the <code>master</code> branch. Results must be addressed within the PR.</li>\\n<li><strong>Asynchronous Review:</strong> While senior developer review remains valuable, the focus should be on code quality, architecture, and integration considerations. Leverage the automated test suite and linting tools to catch common errors.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.2.2.1 Additional Considerations:</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Reviewers should not be the same person who authored the PR.</li>\\n<li>Pull request comments should document any new dependencies introduced or database migration requirements.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.2.2.2 Post-Review Actions</strong></p>\\n<p>Once the pull request is reviewed, it can be:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Approved and merged into master:</strong> The reviewer comments on the PR indicating approval.</li>\\n<li><strong>Rejected with changes:</strong> The reviewer comments with necessary changes. After changes are made by the developer, the PR will be re-reviewed for approval.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>After a pull request is reviewed, approved, and merged, the associated feature branch may be deleted.</p>\\n<p><strong>3.2.2.3 Merge Strategy</strong></p>\\n<p>To maintain a clear and easy-to-follow code history, developers must follow the following guideliens for how pull requests are merged:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Fast-forward and Squash Merges Preferred:</strong> For clean and linear Git history, we recommend using fast-forward merges or squash merges whenever possible. These merge strategies minimize the number of commits in the <code>master</code> branch, making it easier to track code evolution.</li>\\n<li><strong>Branch Merges (With Caution):</strong> Branch merges should only be used in rare cases where preserving the individual commits in the feature branch is crucial.

The release shall include detailed notes outlining all relevant changes.</li>\\n<li><strong>Trigger Deployment:</strong> The CI/CD pipeline will be automatically executed upon the new release, handling the build, test, and deployment process to production.</li>\\n<li><strong>Monitor Post-Release:</strong> Production systems shall be closely monitored to quickly identify and address any issues that may arise after deployment.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><strong>3.2.4 Hotfixes</strong></p>\\n<p>When a critical bug is discovered in production, developers shall follow the following procedure for expedited hotfixes:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li><strong>Hotfix Branch:</strong> Create a hotfix branch directly off the <code>master</code> branch. Clearly name it to indicate its purpose (e.g., <code>hotfix/critical-security-issue</code>).</li>\\n<li><strong>Apply Fix:</strong> Implement the fix on the hotfix branch.</li>\\n<li><strong>Pull Request:</strong> Create a pull request to merge the hotfix into <code>master</code>. While standard reviews apply, prioritize urgency in this case.</li>\\n<li><strong>Automated Deployment:</strong> The CI/CD pipeline will automatically build, test, and deploy the hotfix to production once it's merged into <code>master</code>.</li>\\n<li><strong>Tag for Tracking:</strong> Although a full release isn't necessary, create a release tag on <code>master</code> to track the hotfix deployment.</li>\\n<li><strong>Regression Testing:</strong> Write a test case, if applicable, to prevent the bug from reappearing. Integrate this test into your automated test suite.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><strong>3.2.5 Branching Strategy Summary</strong></p>\\n<p>{{organization.name}}'s branching strategy promotes rapid releases and continuous deployment:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Master Branch:</strong> The <code>master</code> branch always reflects the latest, production-ready code.</li>\\n<li><strong>Feature Branches:</strong> Short-lived feature branches are created directly from <code>master</code>. Use clear naming conventions (e.g., <code>feature/new-widget</code>).</li>\\n<li><strong>Pull Requests:</strong> Once a feature is complete, create a pull request to merge back into <code>master</code>. Automated tests and code reviews are mandatory.</li>\\n<li><strong>Continuous Deployment:</strong> Approved and merged pull requests automatically trigger the CI/CD pipeline, which deploys changes to production.</li>\\n<li><strong>Hotfixes:</strong> If critical, hotfixes branch from <code>master</code>, follow a fast-track pull request process, and are immediately deployed upon merging.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Key Principles</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Small, Frequent Changes:</strong> Encourages smaller, well-tested features that can be rapidly deployed.</li>\\n<li><strong>Automation:</strong> CI/CD pipeline handles testing, build, and deployment for every change to <code>master</code>.</li>\\n<li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Robust monitoring and logging are essential for quick detection and rollback if needed.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.3 Service Vulnerability Reviews</strong></h3>\\n<p>Products and services released by {{organization.name}} require regular reviews for vulnerabilities and attacks.&nbsp;</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>External scan and penetration tests will be performed annually.</li>\\n<li>A severity rating system and process shall be established to prioritize application vulnerabilities for root cause and ensure remediation.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.4 Data Processing Input Validation</strong></h3>\\n<p>All data processing inputs are defined, including the source and criteria for processing.

We prioritize the use of open standards for instrumentation and data collection:</p>\\n<p><strong>3.7.1 Error Handling</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>User-Facing Errors:</strong> Error messages displayed to users must be generic and avoid revealing any internal system details or sensitive data that could be exploited by attackers.</li>\\n<li><strong>Sanitization:</strong> Log files and any error output must be sanitized to ensure they never contain passwords, API keys, session tokens, or other sensitive credentials.</li>\\n<li><strong>Production vs. Non-Production:</strong> Detailed error messages with stack traces may be exposed in development and testing environments, but never in production.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.7.2 Logging, Observability, and OpenTelemetry</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Centralized Logging:</strong> Logs from all systems shall be aggregated into a centralized log management system, ideally one integrated into a broader observability platform.</li>\\n<li><strong>Logging Levels:</strong> Employ a structured logging scheme with clear severity levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL).</li>\\n<li><strong>OpenTelemetry Instrumentation:</strong> Utilize OpenTelemetry (OTel) for instrumenting applications and infrastructure, aiming to collect logs, metrics, and traces.</li>\\n<li><strong>Essential Log Data:</strong> Log entries shall include, at a minimum:\\n<ul>\\n<li>Timestamp with timezone</li>\\n<li>System or component identifier</li>\\n<li>User identifier (if relevant)</li>\\n<li>Event description</li>\\n<li>Severity level</li>\\n<li>IP address or source identifier</li>\\n<li><strong>OpenTelemetry Trace IDs and Span IDs:</strong> For distributed tracing and correlation</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Access to log files and the observability platform must be restricted to authorized personnel, with role-based permissions enforced.</li>\\n<li><strong>Retention and Rotation:</strong> Define a log retention policy aligned with security, operational, and potential compliance requirements. Implement log rotation procedures.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.7.3 Additional Considerations</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Input Validation:</strong> Log data from user input should be treated as untrusted and subject to input validation to prevent log injection attacks.</li>\\n<li><strong>Audit Logging:</strong> Maintain separate audit logs focused on security-related events (logins, privilege changes, data access, etc.), ensuring these integrate with observability systems.</li>\\n<li><strong>Log Analysis, Alerting, and Tracing:</strong>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Configure automated alerting for critical events or anomalous activity.</li>\\n<li>Leverage observability tools to visually correlate OTel data, allowing for rapid debugging across distributed environments.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.8 Data Protection</strong></h3>\\n<p>{{organization.name}} is committed to safeguarding data throughout its lifecycle. The following principles form the foundation of our data protection practices:</p>\\n<p><strong>3.8.1 Principle of Least Privilege</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Access to data shall be granted on a need-to-know basis, with permissions strictly aligned with job responsibilities.</li>\\n<li>Role-based or attribute-based access control (RBAC or ABAC) models shall be used to enforce granular permissions.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.8.2 Data Minimization</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Collection and storage of sensitive data shall be limited to what is strictly necessary to fulfill business purposes.</li>\\n<li>Temporary data copies must be securely erased immediately after their intended use.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.8.3 Credential Protection</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Passwords and other sensitive credentials shall never be stored in plaintext.</strong> Use robust, modern password hashing algorithms specifically designed for the task (e.g., Argon2id, scrypt, bcrypt).</li>\\n<li>Each password or credential must utilize a unique, cryptographically random salt.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.8.4 Data in Transit</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>All data transmission, internally and externally, must occur over secure, encrypted channels using Transport Layer Security (TLS).</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.8.5 Web Application Security</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Prevent Data Exposure:</strong> Client-side code shall be stripped of application comments that could reveal sensitive information.</li>\\n<li><strong>Avoid GET Parameters:</strong> Never transmit sensitive data within GET request parameters.</li>\\n<li><strong>Manage Caching:</strong> Properly configure response headers to disable caching on any pages that display or process sensitive information.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.8.6 Data in Non-Production Environments</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>The use of production data in non-production environments (e.g., development or testing) is strongly discouraged.</li>\\n<li>If absolutely necessary, production data must be:\\n<ul>\\n<li>Masked or de-identified to protect any personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive data.</li>\\n<li>Access restricted exclusively to authorized personnel.</li>\\n<li>Usage subject to documented approvals and justifications.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.9 Communication Security</strong></h3>\\n<p>{{organization.name}} is committed to safeguarding data in transit. The following principles guide our communication security practices:</p>\\n<p><strong>3.9.1 Mandatory Encryption</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>All communication of sensitive data, both internally and externally, must occur exclusively over encrypted channels.</li>\\n<li>Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the mandated encryption protocol. Use version 1.2 or higher, with a strong focus on the most recent stable versions (e.g., TLS 1.3).</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.9.2 Cipher Suite Configuration</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Only modern, strong cipher suites shall be supported. Disable legacy cipher suites known to be vulnerable.</li>\\n<li>Regularly review and update supported cipher suites as new vulnerabilities emerge or standards evolve.</li>\\n<li>Resources like Mozilla's SSL Configuration Generator can aid in selecting secure TLS configurations.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.9.3 Certificate Management</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Use valid, trusted certificates issued by recognized Certificate Authorities (CAs) for all TLS connections.</li>\\n<li>Employ certificate pinning (with caution) or mechanisms like Certificate Transparency Logs for added verification.</li>\\n<li>Implement robust certificate lifecycle management, including timely renewals and revocation processes.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.9.4 Fail Secure</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Never allow fallback to plaintext communication if a TLS connection fails. Systems must always negotiate a secure, encrypted connection according to the configured cipher suites.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.9.5 Additional Considerations</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Web Applications:</strong>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Enforce the use of HTTPS for all web traffic. Use HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) headers to prevent downgrade attacks.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li><strong>Email:</strong>\\n<ul>\\n<li>For sensitive email communications, consider email encryption solutions such as S/MIME or PGP. Be aware of the complexities of email key management.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li><strong>API Endpoints:</strong>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms on external APIs and enforce the strict use of TLS.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Cross-Reference:</strong> This policy aligns with and extends guidelines set forth in the Key Management and Cryptography Policy.</p>\\n<h2><strong>4.0 Customer Notification</strong></h2>\\n<p>As currently available products and services are regularly assessed and reviewed, {{organization.name}} will notify the designated customer contacts within 24 hours if a high-risk vulnerability is found. {{organization.name}} will provide a plan to address the issue and a timeline for when the software or service will have a solution available.

In addition, it applies to all business units that operate within {{organization.name}}&rsquo;s network environment or utilizes its information resources.</p>\\n<h2><strong>3.0 Policy</strong></h2>\\n<p>Changes to information resources shall be managed and executed according to a formal change control process.

Appropriate technical and organizational measures shall be implemented to minimize the identified risks.&nbsp;</li>\\n<li>Test data and accounts are removed before a production system becomes active.</li>\\n<li>Change control procedures related to implementing security patches and software modifications are documented.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Baseline Configuration&nbsp;</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>{{organization.name}} shall consider developing, documenting and maintaining a current baseline configuration standard of the information systems and their components.</li>\\n<li>The baseline configuration standard of the information systems shall be updated as an integral part of the information system component installation.</li>\\n<li>The configuration standard addresses all known security vulnerabilities and is in line with industry-recognized device hardening standards.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.1 Change Initiation and Impact Analysis</strong></h3>\\n<p>All changes, both scheduled and unscheduled, shall be documented, classified into and tracked:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Low impact: affects &lt; 1% of individuals</li>\\n<li>Medium impact: affects between 1% and 5% of individuals</li>\\n<li>High impact: affects &gt; 5% individuals</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>The documentation must identify the scope of the change, areas affected, back-out process, test plan, communication plan and the planned deployment date.</p>\\n<p>Business and technical risks (including the potential impact on performance and security) and costs must be formally considered part of the impact assessment and documented in the change record before submitting for approval. In addition, an implementation plan detailing all the stages required to successfully manage the change (including a test plan and roll-back strategy) shall be developed as part of this phase.</p>\\n<h3><strong>3.2 Change Approval and Implementation</strong></h3>\\n<p>Changes shall be approved formally prior to commencing the change or development and prior to implementing the fully-tested change into the live environment.</p>\\n<p>Impact across the organization and involvement of representatives from other business units will be considered depending on the impact on other business services.</p>\\n<h3><strong>3.3 Post-Implementation Review</strong></h3>\\n<p>A post-implementation review shall be performed to evaluate whether the desired result has been achieved. In the event that a change does not perform as expected or causes issues to one or more areas of the production environment, the attendees of the change meeting will determine if the change should be removed and the production environment returned to its prior stable state.</p>\\n<h3><strong>3.4 Denials</strong></h3>\\n<p>The Business Owner or Change Advisory Board (CAB) or their designee may deny a scheduled or unscheduled change for reasons including, but not limited to:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Inadequate change planning or unit testing</li>\\n<li>Lack of stakeholder acceptance (where applicable)</li>\\n<li>System integration or interoperability concerns</li>\\n<li>Missing or deficient roll-back plans</li>\\n<li>Security implications and risks</li>\\n<li>Timing of the change negatively impacts key business processes</li>\\n<li>Timeframes do not align with resource scheduling (e.g., late-night, weekends, holidays or special events)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.5 Emergency Changes</strong></h3>\\n<p>Changes that can not follow the normal process because of their urgency (such as service outages) shall be considered emergency changes because they require immediate attention and must be implemented quickly to avoid disruption.</p>\\n<p>Approvals shall be obtained for such changes in the form of a discussion with a relevant service manager. Such changes shall be assessed and formally approved retrospectively. In addition, such changes shall be discussed during the periodic Business Owner or CAB meetings for analysis of lessons learned, root cause, impact and status.</p>\\n<h3><strong>3.6 Standard Changes and Patching</strong></h3>\\n<p>Standard changes (also called &ldquo;routine changes&rdquo;) tend to be pre-authorized changes that are considered to have little to no risk associated with them. These changes (for example, applying security patches) are already pre-approved by IT Management, so they can be executed without following the change management approval workflow.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>All systems shall be patched and updated on a documented, regular and timely schedule. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is recommended to be used to aid in setting patching guidelines.</p>\\n<p>The organization must identify systems affected by announced software or firmware flaws, including potential vulnerabilities resulting from these flaws. Security-relevant patches, service packs, hotfixes and anti-virus signatures should be reported to designated personnel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>During security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, and system error handling, flaws discovered should be addressed.</p>\",\"version_num\":3,\"master_version_num\":11,\"created\":\"2021-12-17T14:42:00.780588Z\",\"updated\":\"2024-05-04T18:35:18.853475Z\",\"published_by_id\":99999,\"published_date\":\"2024-05-04T18:35:18.841391Z\",\"review_date\":null,\"status\":\"published\",\"no_rfp_usage\":false,\"category\":\"Security Operations\",\"master_policy_id\":53,\"org_id\":12345,\"id\":94626,\"__entity_type__\":\"policy\",\"__permissions__\":[\"policy:edit\",\"policy:manage_versions\",\"policy:add_org_evidence\",\"policy:upgrade\",\"policy:create_event\",\"policy:create_version\",\"policy:reset_training\",\"policy:deprecate\",\"policy:manage_groups\",\"policy:delete\",\"policy:manage_tags\",\"policy:export_to_evidence\",\"policy:set_reviewer\",\"policy:export\",\"policy:assign\",\"policy:set_review_date\",\"policy:manage_settings\",\"policy:view_details\",\"policy:manage_events\",\"policy:view_awareness\",\"policy:comment\",\"policy:unpublish\",\"policy:manage_acl\",\"policy:mark_not_applicable\"],\"tags\":[],\"assignees\":[{\"first_name\":\"Test\",\"last_name\":\"User\",\"has_reviewed_name\":true,\"is_owner\":true,\"created\":\"2022-01-09T21:25:23.859312Z\",\"updated\":\"2025-01-09T05:00:00.600811Z\",\"suspended\":false,\"training_completed\":null,\"training_expiry_date\":\"2026-01-09\",\"display_name\":\"Test User\",\"short_display_name\":\"TU\",\"pendo_enabled\":true,\"org_id\":12345,\"org\":12345,\"user_id\":99999,\"attachment_id\":null,\"org_role_id\":3,\"id\":888888,\"__entity_type__\":\"organization_member\",\"attachment\":null,\"user\":{\"id\":888888,\"__entity_role__\":null,\"__entity_type__\":\"user\",\"__permissions__\":[\"user:generate_backup_codes\",\"user:set_password\",\"user:add_auth_factor\",\"user:request_email_change\",\"user:reset_password\"],\"email\":\"test@example.com\",\"last_login\":\"2025-07-03T19:44:35.624768Z\",\"status\":\"active\",\"is_locked_out\":null,\"locked_out_until\":null}}],\"current_version_status\":null,\"read_time\":6,\"reviewers\":[]},{\"name\":\"Corporate Ethics\",\"summary\":\"The organization values ethics, trust and integrity throughout its business practices.\",\"details\":\"<h1 style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><strong>{{organization.name}} Corporate Ethics Policy</strong></h1>\\n<h2><strong>1.

When a patch is available, an authorized system administrator must enter a change ticket according to {{organization.name}}&rsquo;s Change Management Policy. All patches should be tested (where applicable) on test systems before being rolled out to production, where possible.</p>\\n<p>In case patches cannot follow the defined schedule, a document must be produced explaining why the patch must be deferred. Permissible deferrals may include a lack of appropriate change windows within the appropriate timeframe or a conflict with other critical changes scheduled at that time. Approvals shall be granted by a senior member of the IT team.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>IT/Information Security is responsible for performing a vulnerability scan on systems after each patch window to show that the patches were installed correctly.&nbsp; Vulnerability scan reports should be reviewed periodically.</p>\\n<h3><strong>3.5 Decommissioning a Server</strong></h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>{{organization.name}} shall define a process for decommissioning servers. This process will be different for virtual servers and physical servers.</li>\\n<li>The data on the servers must be completely destroyed before the machine is taken out of service. The machine should be labeled accordingly.</li>\\n<li>Ensure the shared responsibility with cloud providers and how cloud providers delete customer data when a virtual server is deleted.</li>\\n<li>Ensure cloud provider(s) have appropriate controls around wiping and destruction of hardware.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.6 Compliance&nbsp;</strong></h3>\\n<p>Periodic audits will be performed as authorized by {{organization.name}} management.

This document establishes guidelines for the development of software and systems that are required to be applied to all developments to ensure their maintainability, security and protection against cyber-attacks and accessibility.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>This policy provides for secure and privacy-aware methodologies during the design and implementation of {{organization.name}}&nbsp; products and services. It incorporates best practices in software and operations design and implementation processes with security, privacy and vulnerability reviews throughout their lifecycle so that implementation ensures that {{organization.name}} products are only used as intended and are not vulnerable to attack or abuse. The goal of {{organization.name}} software practices is to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information resources in order to enable secure and successful business operations.</p>\\n<h2><strong>2.0 Scope</strong></h2>\\n<p>This policy covers all development activities carried out by the DevOps team during the design, implementation and maintenance of {{organization.name}} products and services. {{organization.name}} follows a branching strategy workflow for source control and uses the principles outlined in the <a href=\\\"https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/OWASP_SCP_Quick_Reference_Guide_v2.pdf\\\">OWASP Secure Coding Practices</a> to train the DevOps team and defend against the <a href=\\\"https://owasp.org/Top10/\\\">OWASP Top 10</a> security vulnerabilities.</p>\\n<h2><strong>3.0 Policy</strong></h2>\\n<h3><strong>3.1 Design Process</strong></h3>\\n<p>{{organization.name}} DevOps team will consider the security implications of any feature development and/or enhancement to ensure the security and stability of {{organization.name}}&rsquo;s application. Things to consider are:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>How can this feature be misused?</li>\\n<li>Does this feature cause unnecessary data exposure?</li>\\n<li>Does this feature expose an attack vector?</li>\\n<li>Are the data sources used by the feature trusted or untrusted?</li>\\n<li>Does the feature follow the privacy principles of:\\n<ul>\\n<li>Data minimization? (Is only strictly necessary personal information collected, used, stored, and transferred by the feature?)</li>\\n<li>Purpose specification? (Is the existence of the feature, its usage of the personal information and the reasons why it processes the personal information captured by the Privacy Policy?)</li>\\n<li>Use, retention and disclosure?&nbsp; (Does the feature use the personal information, store it and disclose it in ways which are compatible with the purpose(s) for which it is designed?)</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.2 Development Process</strong></h3>\\n<p>{{organization.name}} DevOps follows a streamlined branching strategy designed for continuous delivery. Secure coding practices are enforced using static analysis, dynamic analysis, and dependency scanning tools integrated within the CI/CD pipeline.</p>\\n<p><strong>3.2.1 Feature Development</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Lightweight Specifications:</strong> Features to be developed are described with brief user stories or issue descriptions focused on user outcomes. Technical specifications, if needed, should be concise.</li>\\n<li><strong>Feature Toggles:</strong> Incorporate feature toggles/flags to enable deployment of incomplete work to staging or production environments (behind a toggle) for early testing and feedback.</li>\\n<li><strong>Feature Branches:</strong> Feature branches should be short-lived and merged into <code>master</code> within a few days. During the development process, changes from master should be integrated into the feature branch on an ongoing basis.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.2.2 Pull Requests</strong></p>\\n<p>Pull Requests (PRs) are the primary mechanism for code review and integration in our continuous delivery environment. To ensure quality and timely integration, the following requirements apply to all pull requests:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Automated Reviews:</strong>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Code analysis tools (e.g., static code checkers)</li>\\n<li>Unit tests</li>\\n<li>Security scans (e.g., dependency scanning for vulnerabilities)</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li><strong>Successful execution of these automated checks is mandatory</strong> before a PR can be merged into the <code>master</code> branch. Results must be addressed within the PR.</li>\\n<li><strong>Asynchronous Review:</strong> While senior developer review remains valuable, the focus should be on code quality, architecture, and integration considerations. Leverage the automated test suite and linting tools to catch common errors.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.2.2.1 Additional Considerations:</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Reviewers should not be the same person who authored the PR.</li>\\n<li>Pull request comments should document any new dependencies introduced or database migration requirements.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.2.2.2 Post-Review Actions</strong></p>\\n<p>Once the pull request is reviewed, it can be:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Approved and merged into master:</strong> The reviewer comments on the PR indicating approval.</li>\\n<li><strong>Rejected with changes:</strong> The reviewer comments with necessary changes. After changes are made by the developer, the PR will be re-reviewed for approval.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>After a pull request is reviewed, approved, and merged, the associated feature branch may be deleted.</p>\\n<p><strong>3.2.2.3 Merge Strategy</strong></p>\\n<p>To maintain a clear and easy-to-follow code history, developers must follow the following guideliens for how pull requests are merged:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Fast-forward and Squash Merges Preferred:</strong> For clean and linear Git history, we recommend using fast-forward merges or squash merges whenever possible. These merge strategies minimize the number of commits in the <code>master</code> branch, making it easier to track code evolution.</li>\\n<li><strong>Branch Merges (With Caution):</strong> Branch merges should only be used in rare cases where preserving the individual commits in the feature branch is crucial. This could be for debugging purposes or if the feature branch has a complex history that needs to be maintained separately.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.2.2.3 Commit Message Formatting</strong></p>\\n<p>For \\\"final\\\" commit messages that will be included in the master branch history, developers shall follow the LKML guidelines for informative commit messages. These guidelines emphasize a short subject line describing the change followed by a more detailed body explaining the reasoning and potential impact. Please also observe the following best practices as outlined at&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://cbea.ms/git-commit/\\\">https://cbea.ms/git-commit/</a></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#separate\\\">Separate subject from body with a blank line</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#limit-50\\\">Limit the subject line to 50 characters</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#capitalize\\\">Capitalize the subject line</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#end\\\">Do not end the subject line with a period</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#imperative\\\">Use the imperative mood in the subject line</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#wrap-72\\\">Wrap the body at 72 characters</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#why-not-how\\\">Use the body to explain&nbsp;<em>what</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>why</em>&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;<em>how</em></a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.2.3 Releases</strong></p>\\n<p>To manage releases in a continuous deployment environment, the following steps shall be followed:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li><strong>Tag for Release:</strong> When code on the <code>master</code> branch is considered production-ready, a new release tag shall be created following semantic versioning principles (e.g., v1.2.0).</li>\\n<li><strong>Create Release:</strong> A new Release shall be drafted and linked to the created tag. The release shall include detailed notes outlining all relevant changes.</li>\\n<li><strong>Trigger Deployment:</strong> The CI/CD pipeline will be automatically executed upon the new release, handling the build, test, and deployment process to production.</li>\\n<li><strong>Monitor Post-Release:</strong> Production systems shall be closely monitored to quickly identify and address any issues that may arise after deployment.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><strong>3.2.4 Hotfixes</strong></p>\\n<p>When a critical bug is discovered in production, developers shall follow the following procedure for expedited hotfixes:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li><strong>Hotfix Branch:</strong> Create a hotfix branch directly off the <code>master</code> branch. Clearly name it to indicate its purpose (e.g., <code>hotfix/critical-security-issue</code>).</li>\\n<li><strong>Apply Fix:</strong> Implement the fix on the hotfix branch.</li>\\n<li><strong>Pull Request:</strong> Create a pull request to merge the hotfix into <code>master</code>. While standard reviews apply, prioritize urgency in this case.</li>\\n<li><strong>Automated Deployment:</strong> The CI/CD pipeline will automatically build, test, and deploy the hotfix to production once it's merged into <code>master</code>.</li>\\n<li><strong>Tag for Tracking:</strong> Although a full release isn't necessary, create a release tag on <code>master</code> to track the hotfix deployment.</li>\\n<li><strong>Regression Testing:</strong> Write a test case, if applicable, to prevent the bug from reappearing. Integrate this test into your automated test suite.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><strong>3.2.5 Branching Strategy Summary</strong></p>\\n<p>{{organization.name}}'s branching strategy promotes rapid releases and continuous deployment:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Master Branch:</strong> The <code>master</code> branch always reflects the latest, production-ready code.</li>\\n<li><strong>Feature Branches:</strong> Short-lived feature branches are created directly from <code>master</code>. Use clear naming conventions (e.g., <code>feature/new-widget</code>).</li>\\n<li><strong>Pull Requests:</strong> Once a feature is complete, create a pull request to merge back into <code>master</code>. Automated tests and code reviews are mandatory.</li>\\n<li><strong>Continuous Deployment:</strong> Approved and merged pull requests automatically trigger the CI/CD pipeline, which deploys changes to production.</li>\\n<li><strong>Hotfixes:</strong> If critical, hotfixes branch from <code>master</code>, follow a fast-track pull request process, and are immediately deployed upon merging.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Key Principles</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Small, Frequent Changes:</strong> Encourages smaller, well-tested features that can be rapidly deployed.</li>\\n<li><strong>Automation:</strong> CI/CD pipeline handles testing, build, and deployment for every change to <code>master</code>.</li>\\n<li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Robust monitoring and logging are essential for quick detection and rollback if needed.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.3 Service Vulnerability Reviews</strong></h3>\\n<p>Products and services released by {{organization.name}} require regular reviews for vulnerabilities and attacks.&nbsp;</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>External scan and penetration tests will be performed annually.</li>\\n<li>A severity rating system and process shall be established to prioritize application vulnerabilities for root cause and ensure remediation.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.4 Data Processing Input Validation</strong></h3>\\n<p>All data processing inputs are defined, including the source and criteria for processing. All data processed by the {{organization.name}} application is collected directly by the application.</p>\\n<p>All data processing tasks include a data validation step confirming the integrity of the data to be processed. Data integrity is enforced at the application level.</p>\\n<p>Input fields in the {{organization.name}} application are validated on both the client side and the server side for proper formatting, data type and expected values. The definitive source for data validation is on the trusted system (server). Invalid data will be rejected by the server.</p>\\n<p>All data inputs must be validated for:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Character encoding.</li>\\n<li>Acceptable header/cookie values.</li>\\n<li>Expected data types/ranges/lengths/valid values.</li>\\n<li>Allowed characters.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>User supplied data must never be passed to any dynamic execution function.</p>\\n<h4><strong>3.4.1 Data Processing Schedules</strong></h4>\\n<p>Data processing schedules are defined within the {{organization.name}} application. The results of the processing tasks should be logged and reviewed periodically. Errors and/or exceptions encountered in the processing task generate a detailed exception email that is sent to the DevOps team for remediation.</p>\\n<h3><strong>3.5 Authentication and Password Management</strong></h3>\\n<p>{{organization.name}} adheres to the following practices for secure authentication and management of user passwords:</p>\\n<p><strong>3.5.1 General Authentication</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Authentication is mandatory for all resources and systems within the organization's infrastructure, excluding those explicitly designated as public.</li>\\n<li>Authentication mechanisms shall be enforced by trusted systems designed to fail securely in the event of errors or unauthorized attempts.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.5.2 Password Storage</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>All passwords must be stored using a robust one-way cryptographic hash function specifically designed for password hashing, such as Argon2id, scrypt, or bcrypt.</li>\\n<li>Passwords shall be salted with a unique, randomly generated salt per user prior to hashing.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.5.3 Password Complexity</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Where possible, user passwords must meet the following complexity requirements:\\n<ul>\\n<li>Minimum length of 12 characters.</li>\\n<li>Mixture of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.</li>\\n<li>Passwords must not be found in lists of commonly used, leaked, or easily guessed passwords.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.5.4 Account Lockout</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>User accounts shall be temporarily disabled after a predefined number of consecutive failed login attempts (e.g., 5 attempts within a 15-minute timeframe).</li>\\n<li>Lockout durations shall escalate with subsequent failed attempts.</li>\\n<li>A secure mechanism for users to self-reset or unlock their accounts shall be provided.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.5.5 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) should be available for all users and all access types, and must be required for&nbsp;administrative access and any remote access to the organization's systems.</li>\\n<li>Preferred MFA methods include hardware tokens or authenticator applications. SMS-based MFA should be used only as a last resort.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.5.6 Session Management</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>User sessions shall expire after a period of inactivity (e.g., 30 minutes of inactivity)</li>\\n<li>Absolute session timeouts shall be enforced (e.g., maximum session length of 8 hours)</li>\\n<li>Sensitive operations shall require session re-authentication.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.5.7 Additional Security Measures</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>{{organization.name}} shall implement a centralized identity management system (e.g., LDAP, Active Directory, Single Sign-On solution) for improved user management and access control.</li>\\n<li><strong>3.5.7.1</strong> Access to systems and resources shall be governed by a role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC) framework.</li>\\n<li><strong>3.5.7.2</strong> Regular password audits shall be performed to identify weak, reused, or potentially compromised passwords.</li>\\n<li><strong>3.5.7.3</strong> A breach notification procedure shall be established to inform relevant users and potentially regulatory bodies in the event of a data breach that compromises user credentials.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.6 Access Management</strong></p>\\n<p>{{organization.name}} enforces the following access management principles to protect systems and data:</p>\\n<p><strong>3.6.1 Access Token Handling</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Access tokens shall be generated exclusively on trusted systems with proven security measures.</li>\\n<li>Access token identifiers must use cryptographically secure random number generators (CSPRNG) to ensure unpredictability.</li>\\n<li>Token expiration times shall be strictly enforced, striking a balance between security and user experience. Shorter expirations are preferred, aligned with risk tolerance.</li>\\n<li>Upon successful re-authentication, a new access token must be generated, invalidating the previous token.</li>\\n<li>Access tokens shall never be transmitted over insecure channels (e.g., unencrypted HTTP). Transport Layer Security (TLS) is mandatory.</li>\\n<li>User logout functionality must securely revoke all active access tokens associated with that user's session.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.6.2 Secure Access Control</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Access to all resources shall be governed by a principle of least privilege.</li>\\n<li>Robust access control mechanisms (RBAC or ABAC) shall be implemented and centrally managed.</li>\\n<li>All API requests, without exception, must undergo access control list (ACL) verification. ACLs shall consider both user permissions and relevant organizational context.</li>\\n<li>Access control logic shall be designed with a \\\"fail-closed\\\" approach, ensuring that unauthorized access attempts are denied by default.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.6.3 Production Deployment Safeguards</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>The production deployment branch (or branches) must be protected with strict access controls.</li>\\n<li>Changes to the production branch shall require mandatory code reviews and automated testing before deployment.</li>\\n<li>Direct, unreviewed pushes to the production branch shall be prohibited.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.6.4 Password Management</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Hardcoding passwords within scripts, configuration files, or custom source code is strictly forbidden.</li>\\n<li>Secure mechanisms such as password vaults or environment variable-based secrets management shall be used for handling sensitive credentials.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.6.5 Additional Considerations</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Zero Trust:</strong> Explore the implementation of Zero Trust principles to minimize implicit trust assumptions within the network perimeter.</li>\\n<li><strong>API Security:</strong> Employ comprehensive API security best practices, including input validation, rate limiting, and robust logging and monitoring.</li>\\n<li><strong>Regular Audits:</strong> Conduct regular audits of access permissions, user roles, and privileged accounts, ensuring alignment with the least privilege principle.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.7 Error Handling, Logging, and Observability</strong></h3>\\n<p>{{organization.name}} implements robust error handling, comprehensive logging, and integrated observability practices to safeguard sensitive information, facilitate rapid troubleshooting, and support incident response. We prioritize the use of open standards for instrumentation and data collection:</p>\\n<p><strong>3.7.1 Error Handling</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>User-Facing Errors:</strong> Error messages displayed to users must be generic and avoid revealing any internal system details or sensitive data that could be exploited by attackers.</li>\\n<li><strong>Sanitization:</strong> Log files and any error output must be sanitized to ensure they never contain passwords, API keys, session tokens, or other sensitive credentials.</li>\\n<li><strong>Production vs. Non-Production:</strong> Detailed error messages with stack traces may be exposed in development and testing environments, but never in production.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.7.2 Logging, Observability, and OpenTelemetry</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Centralized Logging:</strong> Logs from all systems shall be aggregated into a centralized log management system, ideally one integrated into a broader observability platform.</li>\\n<li><strong>Logging Levels:</strong> Employ a structured logging scheme with clear severity levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL).</li>\\n<li><strong>OpenTelemetry Instrumentation:</strong> Utilize OpenTelemetry (OTel) for instrumenting applications and infrastructure, aiming to collect logs, metrics, and traces.</li>\\n<li><strong>Essential Log Data:</strong> Log entries shall include, at a minimum:\\n<ul>\\n<li>Timestamp with timezone</li>\\n<li>System or component identifier</li>\\n<li>User identifier (if relevant)</li>\\n<li>Event description</li>\\n<li>Severity level</li>\\n<li>IP address or source identifier</li>\\n<li><strong>OpenTelemetry Trace IDs and Span IDs:</strong> For distributed tracing and correlation</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Access to log files and the observability platform must be restricted to authorized personnel, with role-based permissions enforced.</li>\\n<li><strong>Retention and Rotation:</strong> Define a log retention policy aligned with security, operational, and potential compliance requirements.

Disable legacy cipher suites known to be vulnerable.</li>\\n<li>Regularly review and update supported cipher suites as new vulnerabilities emerge or standards evolve.</li>\\n<li>Resources like Mozilla's SSL Configuration Generator can aid in selecting secure TLS configurations.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.9.3 Certificate Management</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Use valid, trusted certificates issued by recognized Certificate Authorities (CAs) for all TLS connections.</li>\\n<li>Employ certificate pinning (with caution) or mechanisms like Certificate Transparency Logs for added verification.</li>\\n<li>Implement robust certificate lifecycle management, including timely renewals and revocation processes.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.9.4 Fail Secure</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Never allow fallback to plaintext communication if a TLS connection fails. Systems must always negotiate a secure, encrypted connection according to the configured cipher suites.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.9.5 Additional Considerations</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Web Applications:</strong>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Enforce the use of HTTPS for all web traffic. Use HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) headers to prevent downgrade attacks.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li><strong>Email:</strong>\\n<ul>\\n<li>For sensitive email communications, consider email encryption solutions such as S/MIME or PGP. Be aware of the complexities of email key management.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li><strong>API Endpoints:</strong>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms on external APIs and enforce the strict use of TLS.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Cross-Reference:</strong> This policy aligns with and extends guidelines set forth in the Key Management and Cryptography Policy.</p>\\n<h2><strong>4.0 Customer Notification</strong></h2>\\n<p>As currently available products and services are regularly assessed and reviewed, {{organization.name}} will notify the designated customer contacts within 24 hours if a high-risk vulnerability is found. {{organization.name}} will provide a plan to address the issue and a timeline for when the software or service will have a solution available.

In the event that a change does not perform as expected or causes issues to one or more areas of the production environment, the attendees of the change meeting will determine if the change should be removed and the production environment returned to its prior stable state.</p>\\n<h3><strong>3.4 Denials</strong></h3>\\n<p>The Business Owner or Change Advisory Board (CAB) or their designee may deny a scheduled or unscheduled change for reasons including, but not limited to:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Inadequate change planning or unit testing</li>\\n<li>Lack of stakeholder acceptance (where applicable)</li>\\n<li>System integration or interoperability concerns</li>\\n<li>Missing or deficient roll-back plans</li>\\n<li>Security implications and risks</li>\\n<li>Timing of the change negatively impacts key business processes</li>\\n<li>Timeframes do not align with resource scheduling (e.g., late-night, weekends, holidays or special events)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.5 Emergency Changes</strong></h3>\\n<p>Changes that can not follow the normal process because of their urgency (such as service outages) shall be considered emergency changes because they require immediate attention and must be implemented quickly to avoid disruption.</p>\\n<p>Approvals shall be obtained for such changes in the form of a discussion with a relevant service manager. Such changes shall be assessed and formally approved retrospectively. In addition, such changes shall be discussed during the periodic Business Owner or CAB meetings for analysis of lessons learned, root cause, impact and status.</p>\\n<h3><strong>3.6 Standard Changes and Patching</strong></h3>\\n<p>Standard changes (also called &ldquo;routine changes&rdquo;) tend to be pre-authorized changes that are considered to have little to no risk associated with them. These changes (for example, applying security patches) are already pre-approved by IT Management, so they can be executed without following the change management approval workflow.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>All systems shall be patched and updated on a documented, regular and timely schedule. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is recommended to be used to aid in setting patching guidelines.</p>\\n<p>The organization must identify systems affected by announced software or firmware flaws, including potential vulnerabilities resulting from these flaws. Security-relevant patches, service packs, hotfixes and anti-virus signatures should be reported to designated personnel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>During security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, and system error handling, flaws discovered should be addressed.</p>\",\"version_num\":3,\"master_version_num\":11,\"created\":\"2021-12-17T14:42:00.780588Z\",\"updated\":\"2024-05-04T18:35:18.853475Z\",\"published_by_id\":99999,\"published_date\":\"2024-05-04T18:35:18.841391Z\",\"review_date\":null,\"status\":\"published\",\"no_rfp_usage\":false,\"category\":\"Security Operations\",\"master_policy_id\":53,\"org_id\":12345,\"id\":94626,\"__entity_type__\":\"policy\",\"__permissions__\":[\"policy:export\",\"policy:manage_events\",\"policy:manage_acl\",\"policy:assign\",\"policy:comment\",\"policy:create_version\",\"policy:add_org_evidence\",\"policy:deprecate\",\"policy:manage_groups\",\"policy:unpublish\",\"policy:set_review_date\",\"policy:manage_versions\",\"policy:set_reviewer\",\"policy:delete\",\"policy:manage_tags\",\"policy:reset_training\",\"policy:view_awareness\",\"policy:edit\",\"policy:view_details\",\"policy:manage_settings\",\"policy:create_event\",\"policy:upgrade\",\"policy:export_to_evidence\",\"policy:mark_not_applicable\"],\"tags\":[],\"assignees\":[{\"first_name\":\"Test\",\"last_name\":\"User\",\"has_reviewed_name\":true,\"is_owner\":true,\"created\":\"2022-01-09T21:25:23.859312Z\",\"updated\":\"2025-01-09T05:00:00.600811Z\",\"suspended\":false,\"training_completed\":null,\"training_expiry_date\":\"2026-01-09\",\"display_name\":\"Test User\",\"short_display_name\":\"TU\",\"pendo_enabled\":true,\"org_id\":12345,\"org\":12345,\"user_id\":99999,\"attachment_id\":null,\"org_role_id\":3,\"id\":888888,\"__entity_type__\":\"organization_member\",\"attachment\":null,\"user\":{\"id\":888888,\"__entity_role__\":null,\"__entity_type__\":\"user\",\"__permissions__\":[\"user:add_auth_factor\",\"user:reset_password\",\"user:set_password\",\"user:generate_backup_codes\",\"user:request_email_change\"],\"email\":\"test@example.com\",\"last_login\":\"2025-07-03T19:44:35.624768Z\",\"status\":\"active\",\"is_locked_out\":null,\"locked_out_until\":null}}],\"current_version_status\":null,\"read_time\":6,\"reviewers\":[]},{\"name\":\"Corporate Ethics\",\"summary\":\"The organization values ethics, trust and integrity throughout its business practices.\",\"details\":\"<h1 style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><strong>{{organization.name}} Corporate Ethics Policy</strong></h1>\\n<h2><strong>1.

The goal of {{organization.name}} software practices is to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information resources in order to enable secure and successful business operations.</p>\\n<h2><strong>2.0 Scope</strong></h2>\\n<p>This policy covers all development activities carried out by the DevOps team during the design, implementation and maintenance of {{organization.name}} products and services. {{organization.name}} follows a branching strategy workflow for source control and uses the principles outlined in the <a href=\\\"https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/OWASP_SCP_Quick_Reference_Guide_v2.pdf\\\">OWASP Secure Coding Practices</a> to train the DevOps team and defend against the <a href=\\\"https://owasp.org/Top10/\\\">OWASP Top 10</a> security vulnerabilities.</p>\\n<h2><strong>3.0 Policy</strong></h2>\\n<h3><strong>3.1 Design Process</strong></h3>\\n<p>{{organization.name}} DevOps team will consider the security implications of any feature development and/or enhancement to ensure the security and stability of {{organization.name}}&rsquo;s application. Things to consider are:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>How can this feature be misused?</li>\\n<li>Does this feature cause unnecessary data exposure?</li>\\n<li>Does this feature expose an attack vector?</li>\\n<li>Are the data sources used by the feature trusted or untrusted?</li>\\n<li>Does the feature follow the privacy principles of:\\n<ul>\\n<li>Data minimization? (Is only strictly necessary personal information collected, used, stored, and transferred by the feature?)</li>\\n<li>Purpose specification? (Is the existence of the feature, its usage of the personal information and the reasons why it processes the personal information captured by the Privacy Policy?)</li>\\n<li>Use, retention and disclosure?&nbsp; (Does the feature use the personal information, store it and disclose it in ways which are compatible with the purpose(s) for which it is designed?)</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.2 Development Process</strong></h3>\\n<p>{{organization.name}} DevOps follows a streamlined branching strategy designed for continuous delivery. Secure coding practices are enforced using static analysis, dynamic analysis, and dependency scanning tools integrated within the CI/CD pipeline.</p>\\n<p><strong>3.2.1 Feature Development</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Lightweight Specifications:</strong> Features to be developed are described with brief user stories or issue descriptions focused on user outcomes. Technical specifications, if needed, should be concise.</li>\\n<li><strong>Feature Toggles:</strong> Incorporate feature toggles/flags to enable deployment of incomplete work to staging or production environments (behind a toggle) for early testing and feedback.</li>\\n<li><strong>Feature Branches:</strong> Feature branches should be short-lived and merged into <code>master</code> within a few days. During the development process, changes from master should be integrated into the feature branch on an ongoing basis.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.2.2 Pull Requests</strong></p>\\n<p>Pull Requests (PRs) are the primary mechanism for code review and integration in our continuous delivery environment. To ensure quality and timely integration, the following requirements apply to all pull requests:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Automated Reviews:</strong>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Code analysis tools (e.g., static code checkers)</li>\\n<li>Unit tests</li>\\n<li>Security scans (e.g., dependency scanning for vulnerabilities)</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li><strong>Successful execution of these automated checks is mandatory</strong> before a PR can be merged into the <code>master</code> branch. Results must be addressed within the PR.</li>\\n<li><strong>Asynchronous Review:</strong> While senior developer review remains valuable, the focus should be on code quality, architecture, and integration considerations. Leverage the automated test suite and linting tools to catch common errors.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.2.2.1 Additional Considerations:</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Reviewers should not be the same person who authored the PR.</li>\\n<li>Pull request comments should document any new dependencies introduced or database migration requirements.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.2.2.2 Post-Review Actions</strong></p>\\n<p>Once the pull request is reviewed, it can be:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Approved and merged into master:</strong> The reviewer comments on the PR indicating approval.</li>\\n<li><strong>Rejected with changes:</strong> The reviewer comments with necessary changes. After changes are made by the developer, the PR will be re-reviewed for approval.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>After a pull request is reviewed, approved, and merged, the associated feature branch may be deleted.</p>\\n<p><strong>3.2.2.3 Merge Strategy</strong></p>\\n<p>To maintain a clear and easy-to-follow code history, developers must follow the following guideliens for how pull requests are merged:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Fast-forward and Squash Merges Preferred:</strong> For clean and linear Git history, we recommend using fast-forward merges or squash merges whenever possible. These merge strategies minimize the number of commits in the <code>master</code> branch, making it easier to track code evolution.</li>\\n<li><strong>Branch Merges (With Caution):</strong> Branch merges should only be used in rare cases where preserving the individual commits in the feature branch is crucial. This could be for debugging purposes or if the feature branch has a complex history that needs to be maintained separately.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.2.2.3 Commit Message Formatting</strong></p>\\n<p>For \\\"final\\\" commit messages that will be included in the master branch history, developers shall follow the LKML guidelines for informative commit messages. These guidelines emphasize a short subject line describing the change followed by a more detailed body explaining the reasoning and potential impact. Please also observe the following best practices as outlined at&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://cbea.ms/git-commit/\\\">https://cbea.ms/git-commit/</a></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#separate\\\">Separate subject from body with a blank line</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#limit-50\\\">Limit the subject line to 50 characters</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#capitalize\\\">Capitalize the subject line</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#end\\\">Do not end the subject line with a period</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#imperative\\\">Use the imperative mood in the subject line</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#wrap-72\\\">Wrap the body at 72 characters</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#why-not-how\\\">Use the body to explain&nbsp;<em>what</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>why</em>&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;<em>how</em></a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.2.3 Releases</strong></p>\\n<p>To manage releases in a continuous deployment environment, the following steps shall be followed:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li><strong>Tag for Release:</strong> When code on the <code>master</code> branch is considered production-ready, a new release tag shall be created following semantic versioning principles (e.g., v1.2.0).</li>\\n<li><strong>Create Release:</strong> A new Release shall be drafted and linked to the created tag. The release shall include detailed notes outlining all relevant changes.</li>\\n<li><strong>Trigger Deployment:</strong> The CI/CD pipeline will be automatically executed upon the new release, handling the build, test, and deployment process to production.</li>\\n<li><strong>Monitor Post-Release:</strong> Production systems shall be closely monitored to quickly identify and address any issues that may arise after deployment.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><strong>3.2.4 Hotfixes</strong></p>\\n<p>When a critical bug is discovered in production, developers shall follow the following procedure for expedited hotfixes:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li><strong>Hotfix Branch:</strong> Create a hotfix branch directly off the <code>master</code> branch. Clearly name it to indicate its purpose (e.g., <code>hotfix/critical-security-issue</code>).</li>\\n<li><strong>Apply Fix:</strong> Implement the fix on the hotfix branch.</li>\\n<li><strong>Pull Request:</strong> Create a pull request to merge the hotfix into <code>master</code>. While standard reviews apply, prioritize urgency in this case.</li>\\n<li><strong>Automated Deployment:</strong> The CI/CD pipeline will automatically build, test, and deploy the hotfix to production once it's merged into <code>master</code>.</li>\\n<li><strong>Tag for Tracking:</strong> Although a full release isn't necessary, create a release tag on <code>master</code> to track the hotfix deployment.</li>\\n<li><strong>Regression Testing:</strong> Write a test case, if applicable, to prevent the bug from reappearing. Integrate this test into your automated test suite.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><strong>3.2.5 Branching Strategy Summary</strong></p>\\n<p>{{organization.name}}'s branching strategy promotes rapid releases and continuous deployment:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Master Branch:</strong> The <code>master</code> branch always reflects the latest, production-ready code.</li>\\n<li><strong>Feature Branches:</strong> Short-lived feature branches are created directly from <code>master</code>. Use clear naming conventions (e.g., <code>feature/new-widget</code>).</li>\\n<li><strong>Pull Requests:</strong> Once a feature is complete, create a pull request to merge back into <code>master</code>. Automated tests and code reviews are mandatory.</li>\\n<li><strong>Continuous Deployment:</strong> Approved and merged pull requests automatically trigger the CI/CD pipeline, which deploys changes to production.</li>\\n<li><strong>Hotfixes:</strong> If critical, hotfixes branch from <code>master</code>, follow a fast-track pull request process, and are immediately deployed upon merging.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Key Principles</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Small, Frequent Changes:</strong> Encourages smaller, well-tested features that can be rapidly deployed.</li>\\n<li><strong>Automation:</strong> CI/CD pipeline handles testing, build, and deployment for every change to <code>master</code>.</li>\\n<li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Robust monitoring and logging are essential for quick detection and rollback if needed.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.3 Service Vulnerability Reviews</strong></h3>\\n<p>Products and services released by {{organization.name}} require regular reviews for vulnerabilities and attacks.&nbsp;</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>External scan and penetration tests will be performed annually.</li>\\n<li>A severity rating system and process shall be established to prioritize application vulnerabilities for root cause and ensure remediation.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.4 Data Processing Input Validation</strong></h3>\\n<p>All data processing inputs are defined, including the source and criteria for processing. All data processed by the {{organization.name}} application is collected directly by the application.</p>\\n<p>All data processing tasks include a data validation step confirming the integrity of the data to be processed. Data integrity is enforced at the application level.</p>\\n<p>Input fields in the {{organization.name}} application are validated on both the client side and the server side for proper formatting, data type and expected values. The definitive source for data validation is on the trusted system (server). Invalid data will be rejected by the server.</p>\\n<p>All data inputs must be validated for:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Character encoding.</li>\\n<li>Acceptable header/cookie values.</li>\\n<li>Expected data types/ranges/lengths/valid values.</li>\\n<li>Allowed characters.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>User supplied data must never be passed to any dynamic execution function.</p>\\n<h4><strong>3.4.1 Data Processing Schedules</strong></h4>\\n<p>Data processing schedules are defined within the {{organization.name}} application. The results of the processing tasks should be logged and reviewed periodically. Errors and/or exceptions encountered in the processing task generate a detailed exception email that is sent to the DevOps team for remediation.</p>\\n<h3><strong>3.5 Authentication and Password Management</strong></h3>\\n<p>{{organization.name}} adheres to the following practices for secure authentication and management of user passwords:</p>\\n<p><strong>3.5.1 General Authentication</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Authentication is mandatory for all resources and systems within the organization's infrastructure, excluding those explicitly designated as public.</li>\\n<li>Authentication mechanisms shall be enforced by trusted systems designed to fail securely in the event of errors or unauthorized attempts.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.5.2 Password Storage</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>All passwords must be stored using a robust one-way cryptographic hash function specifically designed for password hashing, such as Argon2id, scrypt, or bcrypt.</li>\\n<li>Passwords shall be salted with a unique, randomly generated salt per user prior to hashing.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.5.3 Password Complexity</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Where possible, user passwords must meet the following complexity requirements:\\n<ul>\\n<li>Minimum length of 12 characters.</li>\\n<li>Mixture of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.</li>\\n<li>Passwords must not be found in lists of commonly used, leaked, or easily guessed passwords.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.5.4 Account Lockout</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>User accounts shall be temporarily disabled after a predefined number of consecutive failed login attempts (e.g., 5 attempts within a 15-minute timeframe).</li>\\n<li>Lockout durations shall escalate with subsequent failed attempts.</li>\\n<li>A secure mechanism for users to self-reset or unlock their accounts shall be provided.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.5.5 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) should be available for all users and all access types, and must be required for&nbsp;administrative access and any remote access to the organization's systems.</li>\\n<li>Preferred MFA methods include hardware tokens or authenticator applications. SMS-based MFA should be used only as a last resort.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.5.6 Session Management</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>User sessions shall expire after a period of inactivity (e.g., 30 minutes of inactivity)</li>\\n<li>Absolute session timeouts shall be enforced (e.g., maximum session length of 8 hours)</li>\\n<li>Sensitive operations shall require session re-authentication.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.5.7 Additional Security Measures</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>{{organization.name}} shall implement a centralized identity management system (e.g., LDAP, Active Directory, Single Sign-On solution) for improved user management and access control.</li>\\n<li><strong>3.5.7.1</strong> Access to systems and resources shall be governed by a role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC) framework.</li>\\n<li><strong>3.5.7.2</strong> Regular password audits shall be performed to identify weak, reused, or potentially compromised passwords.</li>\\n<li><strong>3.5.7.3</strong> A breach notification procedure shall be established to inform relevant users and potentially regulatory bodies in the event of a data breach that compromises user credentials.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.6 Access Management</strong></p>\\n<p>{{organization.name}} enforces the following access management principles to protect systems and data:</p>\\n<p><strong>3.6.1 Access Token Handling</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Access tokens shall be generated exclusively on trusted systems with proven security measures.</li>\\n<li>Access token identifiers must use cryptographically secure random number generators (CSPRNG) to ensure unpredictability.</li>\\n<li>Token expiration times shall be strictly enforced, striking a balance between security and user experience. Shorter expirations are preferred, aligned with risk tolerance.</li>\\n<li>Upon successful re-authentication, a new access token must be generated, invalidating the previous token.</li>\\n<li>Access tokens shall never be transmitted over insecure channels (e.g., unencrypted HTTP). Transport Layer Security (TLS) is mandatory.</li>\\n<li>User logout functionality must securely revoke all active access tokens associated with that user's session.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.6.2 Secure Access Control</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Access to all resources shall be governed by a principle of least privilege.</li>\\n<li>Robust access control mechanisms (RBAC or ABAC) shall be implemented and centrally managed.</li>\\n<li>All API requests, without exception, must undergo access control list (ACL) verification. ACLs shall consider both user permissions and relevant organizational context.</li>\\n<li>Access control logic shall be designed with a \\\"fail-closed\\\" approach, ensuring that unauthorized access attempts are denied by default.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.6.3 Production Deployment Safeguards</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>The production deployment branch (or branches) must be protected with strict access controls.</li>\\n<li>Changes to the production branch shall require mandatory code reviews and automated testing before deployment.</li>\\n<li>Direct, unreviewed pushes to the production branch shall be prohibited.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.6.4 Password Management</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Hardcoding passwords within scripts, configuration files, or custom source code is strictly forbidden.</li>\\n<li>Secure mechanisms such as password vaults or environment variable-based secrets management shall be used for handling sensitive credentials.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.6.5 Additional Considerations</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Zero Trust:</strong> Explore the implementation of Zero Trust principles to minimize implicit trust assumptions within the network perimeter.</li>\\n<li><strong>API Security:</strong> Employ comprehensive API security best practices, including input validation, rate limiting, and robust logging and monitoring.</li>\\n<li><strong>Regular Audits:</strong> Conduct regular audits of access permissions, user roles, and privileged accounts, ensuring alignment with the least privilege principle.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.7 Error Handling, Logging, and Observability</strong></h3>\\n<p>{{organization.name}} implements robust error handling, comprehensive logging, and integrated observability practices to safeguard sensitive information, facilitate rapid troubleshooting, and support incident response. We prioritize the use of open standards for instrumentation and data collection:</p>\\n<p><strong>3.7.1 Error Handling</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>User-Facing Errors:</strong> Error messages displayed to users must be generic and avoid revealing any internal system details or sensitive data that could be exploited by attackers.</li>\\n<li><strong>Sanitization:</strong> Log files and any error output must be sanitized to ensure they never contain passwords, API keys, session tokens, or other sensitive credentials.</li>\\n<li><strong>Production vs. Non-Production:</strong> Detailed error messages with stack traces may be exposed in development and testing environments, but never in production.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.7.2 Logging, Observability, and OpenTelemetry</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Centralized Logging:</strong> Logs from all systems shall be aggregated into a centralized log management system, ideally one integrated into a broader observability platform.</li>\\n<li><strong>Logging Levels:</strong> Employ a structured logging scheme with clear severity levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL).</li>\\n<li><strong>OpenTelemetry Instrumentation:</strong> Utilize OpenTelemetry (OTel) for instrumenting applications and infrastructure, aiming to collect logs, metrics, and traces.</li>\\n<li><strong>Essential Log Data:</strong> Log entries shall include, at a minimum:\\n<ul>\\n<li>Timestamp with timezone</li>\\n<li>System or component identifier</li>\\n<li>User identifier (if relevant)</li>\\n<li>Event description</li>\\n<li>Severity level</li>\\n<li>IP address or source identifier</li>\\n<li><strong>OpenTelemetry Trace IDs and Span IDs:</strong> For distributed tracing and correlation</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Access to log files and the observability platform must be restricted to authorized personnel, with role-based permissions enforced.</li>\\n<li><strong>Retention and Rotation:</strong> Define a log retention policy aligned with security, operational, and potential compliance requirements. Implement log rotation procedures.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.7.3 Additional Considerations</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Input Validation:</strong> Log data from user input should be treated as untrusted and subject to input validation to prevent log injection attacks.</li>\\n<li><strong>Audit Logging:</strong> Maintain separate audit logs focused on security-related events (logins, privilege changes, data access, etc.), ensuring these integrate with observability systems.</li>\\n<li><strong>Log Analysis, Alerting, and Tracing:</strong>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Configure automated alerting for critical events or anomalous activity.</li>\\n<li>Leverage observability tools to visually correlate OTel data, allowing for rapid debugging across distributed environments.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.8 Data Protection</strong></h3>\\n<p>{{organization.name}} is committed to safeguarding data throughout its lifecycle. The following principles form the foundation of our data protection practices:</p>\\n<p><strong>3.8.1 Principle of Least Privilege</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Access to data shall be granted on a need-to-know basis, with permissions strictly aligned with job responsibilities.</li>\\n<li>Role-based or attribute-based access control (RBAC or ABAC) models shall be used to enforce granular permissions.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.8.2 Data Minimization</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Collection and storage of sensitive data shall be limited to what is strictly necessary to fulfill business purposes.</li>\\n<li>Temporary data copies must be securely erased immediately after their intended use.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.8.3 Credential Protection</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Passwords and other sensitive credentials shall never be stored in plaintext.</strong> Use robust, modern password hashing algorithms specifically designed for the task (e.g., Argon2id, scrypt, bcrypt).</li>\\n<li>Each password or credential must utilize a unique, cryptographically random salt.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.8.4 Data in Transit</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>All data transmission, internally and externally, must occur over secure, encrypted channels using Transport Layer Security (TLS).</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.8.5 Web Application Security</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Prevent Data Exposure:</strong> Client-side code shall be stripped of application comments that could reveal sensitive information.</li>\\n<li><strong>Avoid GET Parameters:</strong> Never transmit sensitive data within GET request parameters.</li>\\n<li><strong>Manage Caching:</strong> Properly configure response headers to disable caching on any pages that display or process sensitive information.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.8.6 Data in Non-Production Environments</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>The use of production data in non-production environments (e.g., development or testing) is strongly discouraged.</li>\\n<li>If absolutely necessary, production data must be:\\n<ul>\\n<li>Masked or de-identified to protect any personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive data.</li>\\n<li>Access restricted exclusively to authorized personnel.</li>\\n<li>Usage subject to documented approvals and justifications.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.9 Communication Security</strong></h3>\\n<p>{{organization.name}} is committed to safeguarding data in transit. The following principles guide our communication security practices:</p>\\n<p><strong>3.9.1 Mandatory Encryption</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>All communication of sensitive data, both internally and externally, must occur exclusively over encrypted channels.</li>\\n<li>Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the mandated encryption protocol. Use version 1.2 or higher, with a strong focus on the most recent stable versions (e.g., TLS 1.3).</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.9.2 Cipher Suite Configuration</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Only modern, strong cipher suites shall be supported. Disable legacy cipher suites known to be vulnerable.</li>\\n<li>Regularly review and update supported cipher suites as new vulnerabilities emerge or standards evolve.</li>\\n<li>Resources like Mozilla's SSL Configuration Generator can aid in selecting secure TLS configurations.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.9.3 Certificate Management</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Use valid, trusted certificates issued by recognized Certificate Authorities (CAs) for all TLS connections.</li>\\n<li>Employ certificate pinning (with caution) or mechanisms like Certificate Transparency Logs for added verification.</li>\\n<li>Implement robust certificate lifecycle management, including timely renewals and revocation processes.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.9.4 Fail Secure</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Never allow fallback to plaintext communication if a TLS connection fails. Systems must always negotiate a secure, encrypted connection according to the configured cipher suites.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.9.5 Additional Considerations</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Web Applications:</strong>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Enforce the use of HTTPS for all web traffic. Use HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) headers to prevent downgrade attacks.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li><strong>Email:</strong>\\n<ul>\\n<li>For sensitive email communications, consider email encryption solutions such as S/MIME or PGP. Be aware of the complexities of email key management.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li><strong>API Endpoints:</strong>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms on external APIs and enforce the strict use of TLS.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Cross-Reference:</strong> This policy aligns with and extends guidelines set forth in the Key Management and Cryptography Policy.</p>\\n<h2><strong>4.0 Customer Notification</strong></h2>\\n<p>As currently available products and services are regularly assessed and reviewed, {{organization.name}} will notify the designated customer contacts within 24 hours if a high-risk vulnerability is found. {{organization.name}} will provide a plan to address the issue and a timeline for when the software or service will have a solution available.

In the event that a change does not perform as expected or causes issues to one or more areas of the production environment, the attendees of the change meeting will determine if the change should be removed and the production environment returned to its prior stable state.</p>\\n<h3><strong>3.4 Denials</strong></h3>\\n<p>The Business Owner or Change Advisory Board (CAB) or their designee may deny a scheduled or unscheduled change for reasons including, but not limited to:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Inadequate change planning or unit testing</li>\\n<li>Lack of stakeholder acceptance (where applicable)</li>\\n<li>System integration or interoperability concerns</li>\\n<li>Missing or deficient roll-back plans</li>\\n<li>Security implications and risks</li>\\n<li>Timing of the change negatively impacts key business processes</li>\\n<li>Timeframes do not align with resource scheduling (e.g., late-night, weekends, holidays or special events)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.5 Emergency Changes</strong></h3>\\n<p>Changes that can not follow the normal process because of their urgency (such as service outages) shall be considered emergency changes because they require immediate attention and must be implemented quickly to avoid disruption.</p>\\n<p>Approvals shall be obtained for such changes in the form of a discussion with a relevant service manager. Such changes shall be assessed and formally approved retrospectively. In addition, such changes shall be discussed during the periodic Business Owner or CAB meetings for analysis of lessons learned, root cause, impact and status.</p>\\n<h3><strong>3.6 Standard Changes and Patching</strong></h3>\\n<p>Standard changes (also called &ldquo;routine changes&rdquo;) tend to be pre-authorized changes that are considered to have little to no risk associated with them. These changes (for example, applying security patches) are already pre-approved by IT Management, so they can be executed without following the change management approval workflow.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>All systems shall be patched and updated on a documented, regular and timely schedule. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is recommended to be used to aid in setting patching guidelines.</p>\\n<p>The organization must identify systems affected by announced software or firmware flaws, including potential vulnerabilities resulting from these flaws.

Technical specifications, if needed, should be concise.</li>\\n<li><strong>Feature Toggles:</strong> Incorporate feature toggles/flags to enable deployment of incomplete work to staging or production environments (behind a toggle) for early testing and feedback.</li>\\n<li><strong>Feature Branches:</strong> Feature branches should be short-lived and merged into <code>master</code> within a few days. During the development process, changes from master should be integrated into the feature branch on an ongoing basis.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.2.2 Pull Requests</strong></p>\\n<p>Pull Requests (PRs) are the primary mechanism for code review and integration in our continuous delivery environment. To ensure quality and timely integration, the following requirements apply to all pull requests:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Automated Reviews:</strong>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Code analysis tools (e.g., static code checkers)</li>\\n<li>Unit tests</li>\\n<li>Security scans (e.g., dependency scanning for vulnerabilities)</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li><strong>Successful execution of these automated checks is mandatory</strong> before a PR can be merged into the <code>master</code> branch. Results must be addressed within the PR.</li>\\n<li><strong>Asynchronous Review:</strong> While senior developer review remains valuable, the focus should be on code quality, architecture, and integration considerations. Leverage the automated test suite and linting tools to catch common errors.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.2.2.1 Additional Considerations:</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Reviewers should not be the same person who authored the PR.</li>\\n<li>Pull request comments should document any new dependencies introduced or database migration requirements.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.2.2.2 Post-Review Actions</strong></p>\\n<p>Once the pull request is reviewed, it can be:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Approved and merged into master:</strong> The reviewer comments on the PR indicating approval.</li>\\n<li><strong>Rejected with changes:</strong> The reviewer comments with necessary changes. After changes are made by the developer, the PR will be re-reviewed for approval.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>After a pull request is reviewed, approved, and merged, the associated feature branch may be deleted.</p>\\n<p><strong>3.2.2.3 Merge Strategy</strong></p>\\n<p>To maintain a clear and easy-to-follow code history, developers must follow the following guideliens for how pull requests are merged:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Fast-forward and Squash Merges Preferred:</strong> For clean and linear Git history, we recommend using fast-forward merges or squash merges whenever possible. These merge strategies minimize the number of commits in the <code>master</code> branch, making it easier to track code evolution.</li>\\n<li><strong>Branch Merges (With Caution):</strong> Branch merges should only be used in rare cases where preserving the individual commits in the feature branch is crucial.

The release shall include detailed notes outlining all relevant changes.</li>\\n<li><strong>Trigger Deployment:</strong> The CI/CD pipeline will be automatically executed upon the new release, handling the build, test, and deployment process to production.</li>\\n<li><strong>Monitor Post-Release:</strong> Production systems shall be closely monitored to quickly identify and address any issues that may arise after deployment.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><strong>3.2.4 Hotfixes</strong></p>\\n<p>When a critical bug is discovered in production, developers shall follow the following procedure for expedited hotfixes:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li><strong>Hotfix Branch:</strong> Create a hotfix branch directly off the <code>master</code> branch. Clearly name it to indicate its purpose (e.g., <code>hotfix/critical-security-issue</code>).</li>\\n<li><strong>Apply Fix:</strong> Implement the fix on the hotfix branch.</li>\\n<li><strong>Pull Request:</strong> Create a pull request to merge the hotfix into <code>master</code>. While standard reviews apply, prioritize urgency in this case.</li>\\n<li><strong>Automated Deployment:</strong> The CI/CD pipeline will automatically build, test, and deploy the hotfix to production once it's merged into <code>master</code>.</li>\\n<li><strong>Tag for Tracking:</strong> Although a full release isn't necessary, create a release tag on <code>master</code> to track the hotfix deployment.</li>\\n<li><strong>Regression Testing:</strong> Write a test case, if applicable, to prevent the bug from reappearing. Integrate this test into your automated test suite.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><strong>3.2.5 Branching Strategy Summary</strong></p>\\n<p>{{organization.name}}'s branching strategy promotes rapid releases and continuous deployment:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Master Branch:</strong> The <code>master</code> branch always reflects the latest, production-ready code.</li>\\n<li><strong>Feature Branches:</strong> Short-lived feature branches are created directly from <code>master</code>. Use clear naming conventions (e.g., <code>feature/new-widget</code>).</li>\\n<li><strong>Pull Requests:</strong> Once a feature is complete, create a pull request to merge back into <code>master</code>. Automated tests and code reviews are mandatory.</li>\\n<li><strong>Continuous Deployment:</strong> Approved and merged pull requests automatically trigger the CI/CD pipeline, which deploys changes to production.</li>\\n<li><strong>Hotfixes:</strong> If critical, hotfixes branch from <code>master</code>, follow a fast-track pull request process, and are immediately deployed upon merging.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Key Principles</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Small, Frequent Changes:</strong> Encourages smaller, well-tested features that can be rapidly deployed.</li>\\n<li><strong>Automation:</strong> CI/CD pipeline handles testing, build, and deployment for every change to <code>master</code>.</li>\\n<li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Robust monitoring and logging are essential for quick detection and rollback if needed.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.3 Service Vulnerability Reviews</strong></h3>\\n<p>Products and services released by {{organization.name}} require regular reviews for vulnerabilities and attacks.&nbsp;</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>External scan and penetration tests will be performed annually.</li>\\n<li>A severity rating system and process shall be established to prioritize application vulnerabilities for root cause and ensure remediation.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.4 Data Processing Input Validation</strong></h3>\\n<p>All data processing inputs are defined, including the source and criteria for processing.

We prioritize the use of open standards for instrumentation and data collection:</p>\\n<p><strong>3.7.1 Error Handling</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>User-Facing Errors:</strong> Error messages displayed to users must be generic and avoid revealing any internal system details or sensitive data that could be exploited by attackers.</li>\\n<li><strong>Sanitization:</strong> Log files and any error output must be sanitized to ensure they never contain passwords, API keys, session tokens, or other sensitive credentials.</li>\\n<li><strong>Production vs. Non-Production:</strong> Detailed error messages with stack traces may be exposed in development and testing environments, but never in production.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.7.2 Logging, Observability, and OpenTelemetry</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Centralized Logging:</strong> Logs from all systems shall be aggregated into a centralized log management system, ideally one integrated into a broader observability platform.</li>\\n<li><strong>Logging Levels:</strong> Employ a structured logging scheme with clear severity levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL).</li>\\n<li><strong>OpenTelemetry Instrumentation:</strong> Utilize OpenTelemetry (OTel) for instrumenting applications and infrastructure, aiming to collect logs, metrics, and traces.</li>\\n<li><strong>Essential Log Data:</strong> Log entries shall include, at a minimum:\\n<ul>\\n<li>Timestamp with timezone</li>\\n<li>System or component identifier</li>\\n<li>User identifier (if relevant)</li>\\n<li>Event description</li>\\n<li>Severity level</li>\\n<li>IP address or source identifier</li>\\n<li><strong>OpenTelemetry Trace IDs and Span IDs:</strong> For distributed tracing and correlation</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Access to log files and the observability platform must be restricted to authorized personnel, with role-based permissions enforced.</li>\\n<li><strong>Retention and Rotation:</strong> Define a log retention policy aligned with security, operational, and potential compliance requirements. Implement log rotation procedures.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.7.3 Additional Considerations</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Input Validation:</strong> Log data from user input should be treated as untrusted and subject to input validation to prevent log injection attacks.</li>\\n<li><strong>Audit Logging:</strong> Maintain separate audit logs focused on security-related events (logins, privilege changes, data access, etc.), ensuring these integrate with observability systems.</li>\\n<li><strong>Log Analysis, Alerting, and Tracing:</strong>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Configure automated alerting for critical events or anomalous activity.</li>\\n<li>Leverage observability tools to visually correlate OTel data, allowing for rapid debugging across distributed environments.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.8 Data Protection</strong></h3>\\n<p>{{organization.name}} is committed to safeguarding data throughout its lifecycle. The following principles form the foundation of our data protection practices:</p>\\n<p><strong>3.8.1 Principle of Least Privilege</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Access to data shall be granted on a need-to-know basis, with permissions strictly aligned with job responsibilities.</li>\\n<li>Role-based or attribute-based access control (RBAC or ABAC) models shall be used to enforce granular permissions.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.8.2 Data Minimization</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Collection and storage of sensitive data shall be limited to what is strictly necessary to fulfill business purposes.</li>\\n<li>Temporary data copies must be securely erased immediately after their intended use.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.8.3 Credential Protection</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Passwords and other sensitive credentials shall never be stored in plaintext.</strong> Use robust, modern password hashing algorithms specifically designed for the task (e.g., Argon2id, scrypt, bcrypt).</li>\\n<li>Each password or credential must utilize a unique, cryptographically random salt.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.8.4 Data in Transit</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>All data transmission, internally and externally, must occur over secure, encrypted channels using Transport Layer Security (TLS).</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.8.5 Web Application Security</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Prevent Data Exposure:</strong> Client-side code shall be stripped of application comments that could reveal sensitive information.</li>\\n<li><strong>Avoid GET Parameters:</strong> Never transmit sensitive data within GET request parameters.</li>\\n<li><strong>Manage Caching:</strong> Properly configure response headers to disable caching on any pages that display or process sensitive information.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.8.6 Data in Non-Production Environments</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>The use of production data in non-production environments (e.g., development or testing) is strongly discouraged.</li>\\n<li>If absolutely necessary, production data must be:\\n<ul>\\n<li>Masked or de-identified to protect any personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive data.</li>\\n<li>Access restricted exclusively to authorized personnel.</li>\\n<li>Usage subject to documented approvals and justifications.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.9 Communication Security</strong></h3>\\n<p>{{organization.name}} is committed to safeguarding data in transit. The following principles guide our communication security practices:</p>\\n<p><strong>3.9.1 Mandatory Encryption</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>All communication of sensitive data, both internally and externally, must occur exclusively over encrypted channels.</li>\\n<li>Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the mandated encryption protocol. Use version 1.2 or higher, with a strong focus on the most recent stable versions (e.g., TLS 1.3).</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.9.2 Cipher Suite Configuration</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Only modern, strong cipher suites shall be supported. Disable legacy cipher suites known to be vulnerable.</li>\\n<li>Regularly review and update supported cipher suites as new vulnerabilities emerge or standards evolve.</li>\\n<li>Resources like Mozilla's SSL Configuration Generator can aid in selecting secure TLS configurations.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.9.3 Certificate Management</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Use valid, trusted certificates issued by recognized Certificate Authorities (CAs) for all TLS connections.</li>\\n<li>Employ certificate pinning (with caution) or mechanisms like Certificate Transparency Logs for added verification.</li>\\n<li>Implement robust certificate lifecycle management, including timely renewals and revocation processes.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.9.4 Fail Secure</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Never allow fallback to plaintext communication if a TLS connection fails. Systems must always negotiate a secure, encrypted connection according to the configured cipher suites.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.9.5 Additional Considerations</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Web Applications:</strong>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Enforce the use of HTTPS for all web traffic. Use HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) headers to prevent downgrade attacks.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li><strong>Email:</strong>\\n<ul>\\n<li>For sensitive email communications, consider email encryption solutions such as S/MIME or PGP. Be aware of the complexities of email key management.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li><strong>API Endpoints:</strong>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms on external APIs and enforce the strict use of TLS.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Cross-Reference:</strong> This policy aligns with and extends guidelines set forth in the Key Management and Cryptography Policy.</p>\\n<h2><strong>4.0 Customer Notification</strong></h2>\\n<p>As currently available products and services are regularly assessed and reviewed, {{organization.name}} will notify the designated customer contacts within 24 hours if a high-risk vulnerability is found. {{organization.name}} will provide a plan to address the issue and a timeline for when the software or service will have a solution available.

In addition, it applies to all business units that operate within {{organization.name}}&rsquo;s network environment or utilizes its information resources.</p>\\n<h2><strong>3.0 Policy</strong></h2>\\n<p>Changes to information resources shall be managed and executed according to a formal change control process.

Appropriate technical and organizational measures shall be implemented to minimize the identified risks.&nbsp;</li>\\n<li>Test data and accounts are removed before a production system becomes active.</li>\\n<li>Change control procedures related to implementing security patches and software modifications are documented.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Baseline Configuration&nbsp;</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>{{organization.name}} shall consider developing, documenting and maintaining a current baseline configuration standard of the information systems and their components.</li>\\n<li>The baseline configuration standard of the information systems shall be updated as an integral part of the information system component installation.</li>\\n<li>The configuration standard addresses all known security vulnerabilities and is in line with industry-recognized device hardening standards.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.1 Change Initiation and Impact Analysis</strong></h3>\\n<p>All changes, both scheduled and unscheduled, shall be documented, classified into and tracked:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Low impact: affects &lt; 1% of individuals</li>\\n<li>Medium impact: affects between 1% and 5% of individuals</li>\\n<li>High impact: affects &gt; 5% individuals</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>The documentation must identify the scope of the change, areas affected, back-out process, test plan, communication plan and the planned deployment date.</p>\\n<p>Business and technical risks (including the potential impact on performance and security) and costs must be formally considered part of the impact assessment and documented in the change record before submitting for approval. In addition, an implementation plan detailing all the stages required to successfully manage the change (including a test plan and roll-back strategy) shall be developed as part of this phase.</p>\\n<h3><strong>3.2 Change Approval and Implementation</strong></h3>\\n<p>Changes shall be approved formally prior to commencing the change or development and prior to implementing the fully-tested change into the live environment.</p>\\n<p>Impact across the organization and involvement of representatives from other business units will be considered depending on the impact on other business services.</p>\\n<h3><strong>3.3 Post-Implementation Review</strong></h3>\\n<p>A post-implementation review shall be performed to evaluate whether the desired result has been achieved. In the event that a change does not perform as expected or causes issues to one or more areas of the production environment, the attendees of the change meeting will determine if the change should be removed and the production environment returned to its prior stable state.</p>\\n<h3><strong>3.4 Denials</strong></h3>\\n<p>The Business Owner or Change Advisory Board (CAB) or their designee may deny a scheduled or unscheduled change for reasons including, but not limited to:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Inadequate change planning or unit testing</li>\\n<li>Lack of stakeholder acceptance (where applicable)</li>\\n<li>System integration or interoperability concerns</li>\\n<li>Missing or deficient roll-back plans</li>\\n<li>Security implications and risks</li>\\n<li>Timing of the change negatively impacts key business processes</li>\\n<li>Timeframes do not align with resource scheduling (e.g., late-night, weekends, holidays or special events)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.5 Emergency Changes</strong></h3>\\n<p>Changes that can not follow the normal process because of their urgency (such as service outages) shall be considered emergency changes because they require immediate attention and must be implemented quickly to avoid disruption.</p>\\n<p>Approvals shall be obtained for such changes in the form of a discussion with a relevant service manager. Such changes shall be assessed and formally approved retrospectively. In addition, such changes shall be discussed during the periodic Business Owner or CAB meetings for analysis of lessons learned, root cause, impact and status.</p>\\n<h3><strong>3.6 Standard Changes and Patching</strong></h3>\\n<p>Standard changes (also called &ldquo;routine changes&rdquo;) tend to be pre-authorized changes that are considered to have little to no risk associated with them. These changes (for example, applying security patches) are already pre-approved by IT Management, so they can be executed without following the change management approval workflow.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>All systems shall be patched and updated on a documented, regular and timely schedule. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is recommended to be used to aid in setting patching guidelines.</p>\\n<p>The organization must identify systems affected by announced software or firmware flaws, including potential vulnerabilities resulting from these flaws. Security-relevant patches, service packs, hotfixes and anti-virus signatures should be reported to designated personnel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>During security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, and system error handling, flaws discovered should be addressed.</p>\",\"version_num\":3,\"master_version_num\":11,\"created\":\"2021-12-17T14:42:00.780588Z\",\"updated\":\"2024-05-04T18:35:18.853475Z\",\"published_by_id\":99999,\"published_date\":\"2024-05-04T18:35:18.841391Z\",\"review_date\":null,\"status\":\"published\",\"no_rfp_usage\":false,\"category\":\"Security Operations\",\"master_policy_id\":53,\"org_id\":12345,\"id\":94626,\"__entity_type__\":\"policy\",\"__permissions__\":[\"policy:edit\",\"policy:manage_versions\",\"policy:add_org_evidence\",\"policy:upgrade\",\"policy:create_event\",\"policy:create_version\",\"policy:reset_training\",\"policy:deprecate\",\"policy:manage_groups\",\"policy:delete\",\"policy:manage_tags\",\"policy:export_to_evidence\",\"policy:set_reviewer\",\"policy:export\",\"policy:assign\",\"policy:set_review_date\",\"policy:manage_settings\",\"policy:view_details\",\"policy:manage_events\",\"policy:view_awareness\",\"policy:comment\",\"policy:unpublish\",\"policy:manage_acl\",\"policy:mark_not_applicable\"],\"tags\":[],\"assignees\":[{\"first_name\":\"Test\",\"last_name\":\"User\",\"has_reviewed_name\":true,\"is_owner\":true,\"created\":\"2022-01-09T21:25:23.859312Z\",\"updated\":\"2025-01-09T05:00:00.600811Z\",\"suspended\":false,\"training_completed\":null,\"training_expiry_date\":\"2026-01-09\",\"display_name\":\"Test User\",\"short_display_name\":\"TU\",\"pendo_enabled\":true,\"org_id\":12345,\"org\":12345,\"user_id\":99999,\"attachment_id\":null,\"org_role_id\":3,\"id\":888888,\"__entity_type__\":\"organization_member\",\"attachment\":null,\"user\":{\"id\":888888,\"__entity_role__\":null,\"__entity_type__\":\"user\",\"__permissions__\":[\"user:generate_backup_codes\",\"user:set_password\",\"user:add_auth_factor\",\"user:request_email_change\",\"user:reset_password\"],\"email\":\"test@example.com\",\"last_login\":\"2025-07-03T19:44:35.624768Z\",\"status\":\"active\",\"is_locked_out\":null,\"locked_out_until\":null}}],\"current_version_status\":null,\"read_time\":6,\"reviewers\":[]},{\"name\":\"Corporate Ethics\",\"summary\":\"The organization values ethics, trust and integrity throughout its business practices.\",\"details\":\"<h1 style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><strong>{{organization.name}} Corporate Ethics Policy</strong></h1>\\n<h2><strong>1.

When a patch is available, an authorized system administrator must enter a change ticket according to {{organization.name}}&rsquo;s Change Management Policy. All patches should be tested (where applicable) on test systems before being rolled out to production, where possible.</p>\\n<p>In case patches cannot follow the defined schedule, a document must be produced explaining why the patch must be deferred. Permissible deferrals may include a lack of appropriate change windows within the appropriate timeframe or a conflict with other critical changes scheduled at that time. Approvals shall be granted by a senior member of the IT team.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>IT/Information Security is responsible for performing a vulnerability scan on systems after each patch window to show that the patches were installed correctly.&nbsp; Vulnerability scan reports should be reviewed periodically.</p>\\n<h3><strong>3.5 Decommissioning a Server</strong></h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>{{organization.name}} shall define a process for decommissioning servers. This process will be different for virtual servers and physical servers.</li>\\n<li>The data on the servers must be completely destroyed before the machine is taken out of service. The machine should be labeled accordingly.</li>\\n<li>Ensure the shared responsibility with cloud providers and how cloud providers delete customer data when a virtual server is deleted.</li>\\n<li>Ensure cloud provider(s) have appropriate controls around wiping and destruction of hardware.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.6 Compliance&nbsp;</strong></h3>\\n<p>Periodic audits will be performed as authorized by {{organization.name}} management.

This document establishes guidelines for the development of software and systems that are required to be applied to all developments to ensure their maintainability, security and protection against cyber-attacks and accessibility.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>This policy provides for secure and privacy-aware methodologies during the design and implementation of {{organization.name}}&nbsp; products and services. It incorporates best practices in software and operations design and implementation processes with security, privacy and vulnerability reviews throughout their lifecycle so that implementation ensures that {{organization.name}} products are only used as intended and are not vulnerable to attack or abuse. The goal of {{organization.name}} software practices is to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information resources in order to enable secure and successful business operations.</p>\\n<h2><strong>2.0 Scope</strong></h2>\\n<p>This policy covers all development activities carried out by the DevOps team during the design, implementation and maintenance of {{organization.name}} products and services. {{organization.name}} follows a branching strategy workflow for source control and uses the principles outlined in the <a href=\\\"https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/OWASP_SCP_Quick_Reference_Guide_v2.pdf\\\">OWASP Secure Coding Practices</a> to train the DevOps team and defend against the <a href=\\\"https://owasp.org/Top10/\\\">OWASP Top 10</a> security vulnerabilities.</p>\\n<h2><strong>3.0 Policy</strong></h2>\\n<h3><strong>3.1 Design Process</strong></h3>\\n<p>{{organization.name}} DevOps team will consider the security implications of any feature development and/or enhancement to ensure the security and stability of {{organization.name}}&rsquo;s application. Things to consider are:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>How can this feature be misused?</li>\\n<li>Does this feature cause unnecessary data exposure?</li>\\n<li>Does this feature expose an attack vector?</li>\\n<li>Are the data sources used by the feature trusted or untrusted?</li>\\n<li>Does the feature follow the privacy principles of:\\n<ul>\\n<li>Data minimization? (Is only strictly necessary personal information collected, used, stored, and transferred by the feature?)</li>\\n<li>Purpose specification? (Is the existence of the feature, its usage of the personal information and the reasons why it processes the personal information captured by the Privacy Policy?)</li>\\n<li>Use, retention and disclosure?&nbsp; (Does the feature use the personal information, store it and disclose it in ways which are compatible with the purpose(s) for which it is designed?)</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.2 Development Process</strong></h3>\\n<p>{{organization.name}} DevOps follows a streamlined branching strategy designed for continuous delivery. Secure coding practices are enforced using static analysis, dynamic analysis, and dependency scanning tools integrated within the CI/CD pipeline.</p>\\n<p><strong>3.2.1 Feature Development</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Lightweight Specifications:</strong> Features to be developed are described with brief user stories or issue descriptions focused on user outcomes. Technical specifications, if needed, should be concise.</li>\\n<li><strong>Feature Toggles:</strong> Incorporate feature toggles/flags to enable deployment of incomplete work to staging or production environments (behind a toggle) for early testing and feedback.</li>\\n<li><strong>Feature Branches:</strong> Feature branches should be short-lived and merged into <code>master</code> within a few days. During the development process, changes from master should be integrated into the feature branch on an ongoing basis.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.2.2 Pull Requests</strong></p>\\n<p>Pull Requests (PRs) are the primary mechanism for code review and integration in our continuous delivery environment. To ensure quality and timely integration, the following requirements apply to all pull requests:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Automated Reviews:</strong>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Code analysis tools (e.g., static code checkers)</li>\\n<li>Unit tests</li>\\n<li>Security scans (e.g., dependency scanning for vulnerabilities)</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li><strong>Successful execution of these automated checks is mandatory</strong> before a PR can be merged into the <code>master</code> branch. Results must be addressed within the PR.</li>\\n<li><strong>Asynchronous Review:</strong> While senior developer review remains valuable, the focus should be on code quality, architecture, and integration considerations. Leverage the automated test suite and linting tools to catch common errors.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.2.2.1 Additional Considerations:</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Reviewers should not be the same person who authored the PR.</li>\\n<li>Pull request comments should document any new dependencies introduced or database migration requirements.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.2.2.2 Post-Review Actions</strong></p>\\n<p>Once the pull request is reviewed, it can be:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Approved and merged into master:</strong> The reviewer comments on the PR indicating approval.</li>\\n<li><strong>Rejected with changes:</strong> The reviewer comments with necessary changes. After changes are made by the developer, the PR will be re-reviewed for approval.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>After a pull request is reviewed, approved, and merged, the associated feature branch may be deleted.</p>\\n<p><strong>3.2.2.3 Merge Strategy</strong></p>\\n<p>To maintain a clear and easy-to-follow code history, developers must follow the following guideliens for how pull requests are merged:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Fast-forward and Squash Merges Preferred:</strong> For clean and linear Git history, we recommend using fast-forward merges or squash merges whenever possible. These merge strategies minimize the number of commits in the <code>master</code> branch, making it easier to track code evolution.</li>\\n<li><strong>Branch Merges (With Caution):</strong> Branch merges should only be used in rare cases where preserving the individual commits in the feature branch is crucial. This could be for debugging purposes or if the feature branch has a complex history that needs to be maintained separately.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.2.2.3 Commit Message Formatting</strong></p>\\n<p>For \\\"final\\\" commit messages that will be included in the master branch history, developers shall follow the LKML guidelines for informative commit messages. These guidelines emphasize a short subject line describing the change followed by a more detailed body explaining the reasoning and potential impact. Please also observe the following best practices as outlined at&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://cbea.ms/git-commit/\\\">https://cbea.ms/git-commit/</a></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#separate\\\">Separate subject from body with a blank line</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#limit-50\\\">Limit the subject line to 50 characters</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#capitalize\\\">Capitalize the subject line</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#end\\\">Do not end the subject line with a period</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#imperative\\\">Use the imperative mood in the subject line</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#wrap-72\\\">Wrap the body at 72 characters</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#why-not-how\\\">Use the body to explain&nbsp;<em>what</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>why</em>&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;<em>how</em></a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.2.3 Releases</strong></p>\\n<p>To manage releases in a continuous deployment environment, the following steps shall be followed:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li><strong>Tag for Release:</strong> When code on the <code>master</code> branch is considered production-ready, a new release tag shall be created following semantic versioning principles (e.g., v1.2.0).</li>\\n<li><strong>Create Release:</strong> A new Release shall be drafted and linked to the created tag. The release shall include detailed notes outlining all relevant changes.</li>\\n<li><strong>Trigger Deployment:</strong> The CI/CD pipeline will be automatically executed upon the new release, handling the build, test, and deployment process to production.</li>\\n<li><strong>Monitor Post-Release:</strong> Production systems shall be closely monitored to quickly identify and address any issues that may arise after deployment.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><strong>3.2.4 Hotfixes</strong></p>\\n<p>When a critical bug is discovered in production, developers shall follow the following procedure for expedited hotfixes:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li><strong>Hotfix Branch:</strong> Create a hotfix branch directly off the <code>master</code> branch. Clearly name it to indicate its purpose (e.g., <code>hotfix/critical-security-issue</code>).</li>\\n<li><strong>Apply Fix:</strong> Implement the fix on the hotfix branch.</li>\\n<li><strong>Pull Request:</strong> Create a pull request to merge the hotfix into <code>master</code>. While standard reviews apply, prioritize urgency in this case.</li>\\n<li><strong>Automated Deployment:</strong> The CI/CD pipeline will automatically build, test, and deploy the hotfix to production once it's merged into <code>master</code>.</li>\\n<li><strong>Tag for Tracking:</strong> Although a full release isn't necessary, create a release tag on <code>master</code> to track the hotfix deployment.</li>\\n<li><strong>Regression Testing:</strong> Write a test case, if applicable, to prevent the bug from reappearing. Integrate this test into your automated test suite.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p><strong>3.2.5 Branching Strategy Summary</strong></p>\\n<p>{{organization.name}}'s branching strategy promotes rapid releases and continuous deployment:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Master Branch:</strong> The <code>master</code> branch always reflects the latest, production-ready code.</li>\\n<li><strong>Feature Branches:</strong> Short-lived feature branches are created directly from <code>master</code>. Use clear naming conventions (e.g., <code>feature/new-widget</code>).</li>\\n<li><strong>Pull Requests:</strong> Once a feature is complete, create a pull request to merge back into <code>master</code>. Automated tests and code reviews are mandatory.</li>\\n<li><strong>Continuous Deployment:</strong> Approved and merged pull requests automatically trigger the CI/CD pipeline, which deploys changes to production.</li>\\n<li><strong>Hotfixes:</strong> If critical, hotfixes branch from <code>master</code>, follow a fast-track pull request process, and are immediately deployed upon merging.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Key Principles</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Small, Frequent Changes:</strong> Encourages smaller, well-tested features that can be rapidly deployed.</li>\\n<li><strong>Automation:</strong> CI/CD pipeline handles testing, build, and deployment for every change to <code>master</code>.</li>\\n<li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Robust monitoring and logging are essential for quick detection and rollback if needed.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.3 Service Vulnerability Reviews</strong></h3>\\n<p>Products and services released by {{organization.name}} require regular reviews for vulnerabilities and attacks.&nbsp;</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>External scan and penetration tests will be performed annually.</li>\\n<li>A severity rating system and process shall be established to prioritize application vulnerabilities for root cause and ensure remediation.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.4 Data Processing Input Validation</strong></h3>\\n<p>All data processing inputs are defined, including the source and criteria for processing. All data processed by the {{organization.name}} application is collected directly by the application.</p>\\n<p>All data processing tasks include a data validation step confirming the integrity of the data to be processed. Data integrity is enforced at the application level.</p>\\n<p>Input fields in the {{organization.name}} application are validated on both the client side and the server side for proper formatting, data type and expected values. The definitive source for data validation is on the trusted system (server). Invalid data will be rejected by the server.</p>\\n<p>All data inputs must be validated for:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Character encoding.</li>\\n<li>Acceptable header/cookie values.</li>\\n<li>Expected data types/ranges/lengths/valid values.</li>\\n<li>Allowed characters.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>User supplied data must never be passed to any dynamic execution function.</p>\\n<h4><strong>3.4.1 Data Processing Schedules</strong></h4>\\n<p>Data processing schedules are defined within the {{organization.name}} application. The results of the processing tasks should be logged and reviewed periodically. Errors and/or exceptions encountered in the processing task generate a detailed exception email that is sent to the DevOps team for remediation.</p>\\n<h3><strong>3.5 Authentication and Password Management</strong></h3>\\n<p>{{organization.name}} adheres to the following practices for secure authentication and management of user passwords:</p>\\n<p><strong>3.5.1 General Authentication</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Authentication is mandatory for all resources and systems within the organization's infrastructure, excluding those explicitly designated as public.</li>\\n<li>Authentication mechanisms shall be enforced by trusted systems designed to fail securely in the event of errors or unauthorized attempts.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.5.2 Password Storage</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>All passwords must be stored using a robust one-way cryptographic hash function specifically designed for password hashing, such as Argon2id, scrypt, or bcrypt.</li>\\n<li>Passwords shall be salted with a unique, randomly generated salt per user prior to hashing.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.5.3 Password Complexity</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Where possible, user passwords must meet the following complexity requirements:\\n<ul>\\n<li>Minimum length of 12 characters.</li>\\n<li>Mixture of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.</li>\\n<li>Passwords must not be found in lists of commonly used, leaked, or easily guessed passwords.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.5.4 Account Lockout</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>User accounts shall be temporarily disabled after a predefined number of consecutive failed login attempts (e.g., 5 attempts within a 15-minute timeframe).</li>\\n<li>Lockout durations shall escalate with subsequent failed attempts.</li>\\n<li>A secure mechanism for users to self-reset or unlock their accounts shall be provided.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.5.5 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) should be available for all users and all access types, and must be required for&nbsp;administrative access and any remote access to the organization's systems.</li>\\n<li>Preferred MFA methods include hardware tokens or authenticator applications. SMS-based MFA should be used only as a last resort.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.5.6 Session Management</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>User sessions shall expire after a period of inactivity (e.g., 30 minutes of inactivity)</li>\\n<li>Absolute session timeouts shall be enforced (e.g., maximum session length of 8 hours)</li>\\n<li>Sensitive operations shall require session re-authentication.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.5.7 Additional Security Measures</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>{{organization.name}} shall implement a centralized identity management system (e.g., LDAP, Active Directory, Single Sign-On solution) for improved user management and access control.</li>\\n<li><strong>3.5.7.1</strong> Access to systems and resources shall be governed by a role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC) framework.</li>\\n<li><strong>3.5.7.2</strong> Regular password audits shall be performed to identify weak, reused, or potentially compromised passwords.</li>\\n<li><strong>3.5.7.3</strong> A breach notification procedure shall be established to inform relevant users and potentially regulatory bodies in the event of a data breach that compromises user credentials.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.6 Access Management</strong></p>\\n<p>{{organization.name}} enforces the following access management principles to protect systems and data:</p>\\n<p><strong>3.6.1 Access Token Handling</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Access tokens shall be generated exclusively on trusted systems with proven security measures.</li>\\n<li>Access token identifiers must use cryptographically secure random number generators (CSPRNG) to ensure unpredictability.</li>\\n<li>Token expiration times shall be strictly enforced, striking a balance between security and user experience. Shorter expirations are preferred, aligned with risk tolerance.</li>\\n<li>Upon successful re-authentication, a new access token must be generated, invalidating the previous token.</li>\\n<li>Access tokens shall never be transmitted over insecure channels (e.g., unencrypted HTTP). Transport Layer Security (TLS) is mandatory.</li>\\n<li>User logout functionality must securely revoke all active access tokens associated with that user's session.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.6.2 Secure Access Control</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Access to all resources shall be governed by a principle of least privilege.</li>\\n<li>Robust access control mechanisms (RBAC or ABAC) shall be implemented and centrally managed.</li>\\n<li>All API requests, without exception, must undergo access control list (ACL) verification. ACLs shall consider both user permissions and relevant organizational context.</li>\\n<li>Access control logic shall be designed with a \\\"fail-closed\\\" approach, ensuring that unauthorized access attempts are denied by default.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.6.3 Production Deployment Safeguards</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>The production deployment branch (or branches) must be protected with strict access controls.</li>\\n<li>Changes to the production branch shall require mandatory code reviews and automated testing before deployment.</li>\\n<li>Direct, unreviewed pushes to the production branch shall be prohibited.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.6.4 Password Management</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Hardcoding passwords within scripts, configuration files, or custom source code is strictly forbidden.</li>\\n<li>Secure mechanisms such as password vaults or environment variable-based secrets management shall be used for handling sensitive credentials.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.6.5 Additional Considerations</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Zero Trust:</strong> Explore the implementation of Zero Trust principles to minimize implicit trust assumptions within the network perimeter.</li>\\n<li><strong>API Security:</strong> Employ comprehensive API security best practices, including input validation, rate limiting, and robust logging and monitoring.</li>\\n<li><strong>Regular Audits:</strong> Conduct regular audits of access permissions, user roles, and privileged accounts, ensuring alignment with the least privilege principle.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.7 Error Handling, Logging, and Observability</strong></h3>\\n<p>{{organization.name}} implements robust error handling, comprehensive logging, and integrated observability practices to safeguard sensitive information, facilitate rapid troubleshooting, and support incident response. We prioritize the use of open standards for instrumentation and data collection:</p>\\n<p><strong>3.7.1 Error Handling</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>User-Facing Errors:</strong> Error messages displayed to users must be generic and avoid revealing any internal system details or sensitive data that could be exploited by attackers.</li>\\n<li><strong>Sanitization:</strong> Log files and any error output must be sanitized to ensure they never contain passwords, API keys, session tokens, or other sensitive credentials.</li>\\n<li><strong>Production vs. Non-Production:</strong> Detailed error messages with stack traces may be exposed in development and testing environments, but never in production.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.7.2 Logging, Observability, and OpenTelemetry</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Centralized Logging:</strong> Logs from all systems shall be aggregated into a centralized log management system, ideally one integrated into a broader observability platform.</li>\\n<li><strong>Logging Levels:</strong> Employ a structured logging scheme with clear severity levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL).</li>\\n<li><strong>OpenTelemetry Instrumentation:</strong> Utilize OpenTelemetry (OTel) for instrumenting applications and infrastructure, aiming to collect logs, metrics, and traces.</li>\\n<li><strong>Essential Log Data:</strong> Log entries shall include, at a minimum:\\n<ul>\\n<li>Timestamp with timezone</li>\\n<li>System or component identifier</li>\\n<li>User identifier (if relevant)</li>\\n<li>Event description</li>\\n<li>Severity level</li>\\n<li>IP address or source identifier</li>\\n<li><strong>OpenTelemetry Trace IDs and Span IDs:</strong> For distributed tracing and correlation</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Access to log files and the observability platform must be restricted to authorized personnel, with role-based permissions enforced.</li>\\n<li><strong>Retention and Rotation:</strong> Define a log retention policy aligned with security, operational, and potential compliance requirements.

Disable legacy cipher suites known to be vulnerable.</li>\\n<li>Regularly review and update supported cipher suites as new vulnerabilities emerge or standards evolve.</li>\\n<li>Resources like Mozilla's SSL Configuration Generator can aid in selecting secure TLS configurations.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.9.3 Certificate Management</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Use valid, trusted certificates issued by recognized Certificate Authorities (CAs) for all TLS connections.</li>\\n<li>Employ certificate pinning (with caution) or mechanisms like Certificate Transparency Logs for added verification.</li>\\n<li>Implement robust certificate lifecycle management, including timely renewals and revocation processes.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.9.4 Fail Secure</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Never allow fallback to plaintext communication if a TLS connection fails. Systems must always negotiate a secure, encrypted connection according to the configured cipher suites.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>3.9.5 Additional Considerations</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Web Applications:</strong>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Enforce the use of HTTPS for all web traffic. Use HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) headers to prevent downgrade attacks.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li><strong>Email:</strong>\\n<ul>\\n<li>For sensitive email communications, consider email encryption solutions such as S/MIME or PGP. Be aware of the complexities of email key management.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li><strong>API Endpoints:</strong>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms on external APIs and enforce the strict use of TLS.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Cross-Reference:</strong> This policy aligns with and extends guidelines set forth in the Key Management and Cryptography Policy.</p>\\n<h2><strong>4.0 Customer Notification</strong></h2>\\n<p>As currently available products and services are regularly assessed and reviewed, {{organization.name}} will notify the designated customer contacts within 24 hours if a high-risk vulnerability is found. {{organization.name}} will provide a plan to address the issue and a timeline for when the software or service will have a solution available.

In that case, they shall report the incident in alignment with {{organization.name}}&rsquo;s incident handling process.&nbsp;</li>\\n<li>Devices shall not be &ldquo;jailbroken&rdquo; or &ldquo;rooted&rdquo;* or have any software/firmware installed designed to gain access to functionality not intended to be exposed to the user.&nbsp;</li>\\n<li>Users shall not load pirated software or illegal content onto their devices.&nbsp;</li>\\n<li>Applications shall only be installed from official platform-approved sources (device stores). Installation of applications from untrusted sources is forbidden.</li>\\n<li>Install security-relevant software and firmware updates within defined time period of the release of the updates.</li>\\n<li>Devices shall be encrypted in line with {{organization.name}}&rsquo;s compliance standards.&nbsp;</li>\\n<li>Users should be cautious about the merging of personal and work email accounts on their devices. They must ensure that {{organization.name}}&rsquo;s data is only sent through the corporate email system. If a user suspects that {{organization.name}}&rsquo;s data has been sent from a personal email account, either in the body text or as an attachment, they must notify {{organization.name}}&rsquo;s IT immediately.&nbsp;</li>\\n<li>For mobile devices, the user is responsible for the backup of their personal data as {{organization.name}} will accept no responsibility for the loss of files due to a non-compliant device wiped for security reasons.</li>\\n<li>Identify the types of installation that is allowed (e.g. security patches or software updates) and prohibit the installation of software that is not specifically approved by the organization</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>The above requirements will be checked regularly by users and the IT team. Should a device be non-compliant, resulting in losing access to email or data, a device lock or a device wipe will be activated in severe cases.&nbsp;</p>\\n<h3><strong>3.3 Physical Safeguards</strong></h3>\\n<p>Physical access to workstations and mobile devices shall be restricted to authorized only personnel. Employees shall prevent unauthorized viewing of information on a screen by:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Securing devices (screen lock or logout) before leaving the area to prevent unauthorized access.&nbsp;</li>\\n<li>Enabling a password-protected screen saver with a short timeout period ensures that devices are protected when left unattended.</li>\\n<li>Keeping food and drink away from devices to avoid accidental spills.&nbsp;</li>\\n<li>Securing laptops that contain sensitive information by using cable locks or locking laptops up in drawers or cabinets.&nbsp;</li>\\n<li>Ensuring that screens/monitors are positioned away from public view. If necessary, install privacy screen filters or other physical barriers to public viewing.&nbsp;</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.4 Mobile Device Management Remote Wipe</strong></h3>\\n<p>By connecting to {{organization.name}} technology resources, mobile devices gain the capability of being wiped remotely by {{organization.name}} IT department.</p>\\n<p>When the user or the IT department initiates a remote wipe, the user&rsquo;s mobile device will be wiped off all data and settings. Wiping data, documents, files, settings and applications in the event a device is lost, stolen or compromised in any way is critical to protecting our company and its confidential data.</p>\\n<p>{{organization.name}} recommends that users backup personal data frequently to minimize loss if a remote wipe is necessary.</p>\\n<p>A remote wipe will only be initiated if IT deems it appropriate. Examples of situations requiring remote wipe include, but are not limited to:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>A lost, stolen or believed to be a compromised device</li>\\n<li>A device that contains an app known to have a security vulnerability</li>\\n<li>A device that is not compliant and or does not grant inspection with the {{organization.name}}&rsquo;s policy</li>\\n<li>The device belongs to a user that no longer works with or has exited&nbsp; {{organization.name}}</li>\\n<li>Termination of employment in which the user has not already cleared all {{organization.name}} data by another method approved by IT</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3><strong>3.5 Management and Administration&nbsp;</strong></h3>\\n<p>The IT department shall ensure that workstations and mobile devices have all critical security updates patched and installed promptly.</p>\",\"version_num\":2,\"master_version_num\":13,\"created\":\"2021-12-17T14:42:00.952449Z\",\"updated\":\"2024-05-05T19:43:59.098520Z\",\"published_by_id\":99999,\"published_date\":\"2024-05-05T19:43:59.087975Z\",\"review_date\":null,\"status\":\"published\",\"no_rfp_usage\":false,\"category\":\"Information and Communication\",\"master_policy_id\":24,\"org_id\":12345,\"id\":94637,\"__entity_type__\":\"policy\",\"__permissions__\":[\"policy:edit\",\"policy:manage_versions\",\"policy:add_org_evidence\",\"policy:upgrade\",\"policy:create_event\",\"policy:create_version\",\"policy:reset_training\",\"policy:deprecate\",\"policy:manage_groups\",\"policy:delete\",\"policy:manage_tags\",\"policy:export_to_evidence\",\"policy:set_reviewer\",\"policy:export\",\"policy:assign\",\"policy:set_review_date\",\"policy:manage_settings\",\"policy:view_details\",\"policy:manage_events\",\"policy:view_awareness\",\"policy:comment\",\"policy:unpublish\",\"policy:manage_acl\",\"policy:mark_not_applicable\"],\"tags\":[],\"assignees\":[{\"first_name\":\"Test\",\"last_name\":\"User\",\"has_reviewed_name\":true,\"is_owner\":true,\"created\":\"2022-01-09T21:25:23.859312Z\",\"updated\":\"2025-01-09T05:00:00.600811Z\",\"suspended\":false,\"training_completed\":null,\"training_expiry_date\":\"2026-01-09\",\"display_name\":\"Test User\",\"short_display_name\":\"TU\",\"pendo_enabled\":true,\"org_id\":12345,\"org\":12345,\"user_id\":99999,\"attachment_id\":null,\"org_role_id\":3,\"id\":888888,\"__entity_type__\":\"organization_member\",\"attachment\":null,\"user\":{\"id\":888888,\"__entity_role__\":null,\"__entity_type__\":\"user\",\"__permissions__\":[\"user:generate_backup_codes\",\"user:set_password\",\"user:add_auth_factor\",\"user:request_email_change\",\"user:reset_password\"],\"email\":\"test@example.com\",\"last_login\":\"2025-07-03T19:44:35.624768Z\",\"status\":\"active\",\"is_locked_out\":null,\"locked_out_until\":null}}],\"current_version_status\":null,\"read_time\":6,\"reviewers\":[]}]}"
