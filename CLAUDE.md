# CLAUDE.md - AI Assistant Guide for GRCTool Users

## üéØ PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project uses **GRCTool** - an automated compliance evidence collection CLI tool.

**What is GRCTool?**
- Automates evidence collection for SOC2, ISO27001, and other compliance frameworks
- Syncs policies, controls, and evidence tasks from Tugboat Logic
- Integrates with infrastructure (Terraform, GitHub, Google Workspace)
- Generates compliance evidence using AI and automated scanning

**Your Role as an AI Assistant:**
Help users navigate their compliance program, generate evidence, and understand their security controls.

## üìÅ PROJECT STRUCTURE

This project is organized as follows:

**Data Directory**: /Users/erik/Projects/grctool

## üîß COMMON COMMANDS

### Initial Setup
```bash
# 1. Initialize configuration (safe to run multiple times)
grctool init

# 2. Authenticate with Tugboat Logic (browser-based)
grctool auth login

# 3. Verify authentication
grctool auth status
```

### Data Synchronization
```bash
# Sync latest data from Tugboat Logic
grctool sync

# This downloads:
# - Policies (governance documents)
# - Controls (security requirements)
# - Evidence Tasks (what evidence needs to be collected)
```

### Evidence Collection Workflow
```bash
# 1. List all evidence tasks
grctool tool evidence-task-list

# 2. Get details about a specific task
grctool tool evidence-task-details --task-ref ET-0001

# 3. Generate evidence for a task
grctool evidence generate ET-0001

# 4. Review generated evidence
grctool evidence review ET-0001
```

## üè∑Ô∏è NAMING CONVENTIONS

Understanding file and reference naming:

- **Evidence Tasks**: `ET-0001`, `ET-0104` (4-digit zero-padded)
- **Policies**: `POL-0001`, `POL-0002` (4-digit zero-padded)
- **Controls**: `AC-01`, `CC-01.1`, `SO-19` (varies by framework)
- **Evidence Files**: `ET-0001-327992-access_registration.json`

## üìä KEY CONCEPTS

### Policies
High-level governance documents that define "what" the organization does.
Example: "Access Control Policy", "Data Protection Policy"

### Controls
Specific security requirements that implement policies. Define "how" things are done.
Example: "CC6.8 - Logical access controls restrict access to authorized users"

### Evidence Tasks
Specific evidence that must be collected to prove controls are implemented.
Example: "ET-0047 - GitHub Repository Access Controls - Show team permissions"

### Tools
Automated scanners and analyzers that collect evidence from infrastructure:
- **Terraform Tools** (7 tools) - Infrastructure as Code security
- **GitHub Tools** (6 tools) - Repository access, workflows, security features
- **Google Workspace Tools** - User access, groups, drive permissions
- **Atmos Tools** - Multi-environment stack analysis

## üîç COMMON USER QUESTIONS

### "What evidence do I need to collect?"
```bash
grctool tool evidence-task-list
```
This shows all pending evidence tasks with status and assignees.

### "What controls apply to [some system]?"
```bash
# Search through synced controls
grep -r "keyword" /Users/erik/Projects/grctool//controls/

# Or ask me - I can read the control files and explain them
```

### "How do I generate evidence for GitHub access controls?"
```bash
# Use the specialized GitHub permission tool
grctool tool github-permissions --repository owner/repo
```

### "What Terraform security evidence can be collected?"
```bash
# Use the comprehensive indexer for fast queries
grctool tool terraform-security-indexer --query-type control_mapping

# Or use the security analyzer for deep analysis
grctool tool terraform-security-analyzer --security-domain all
```

## üîê AUTHENTICATION

GRCTool uses **browser-based authentication** with Tugboat Logic:

```bash
# Login (opens Safari, saves credentials securely)
grctool auth login

# Check status
grctool auth status

# Logout (clears credentials)
grctool auth logout
```

**Note**: Credentials are stored in /auth/ and are automatically refreshed.

## üéØ HELPING USERS WITH EVIDENCE

When a user asks for help with evidence collection:

1. **Understand the task**: Read the evidence task JSON file
2. **Identify applicable tools**: Suggest which grctool tools can collect this evidence
3. **Review existing evidence**: Check if evidence already exists
4. **Guide evidence generation**: Walk through tool usage
5. **Help with formatting**: Ensure evidence meets auditor requirements

### Example: Helping with ET-0047 (GitHub Repository Access)

```bash
# 1. Get task details
grctool tool evidence-task-details --task-ref ET-0047

# 2. Check what controls it maps to
# I can read: /Users/erik/Projects/grctool//evidence_tasks/ET-0047-*.json

# 3. Run the appropriate tool
grctool tool github-permissions --repository org/repo --output-format matrix

# 4. Review and format the output for compliance
```
