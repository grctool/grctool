  "description": "Provide evidence that CI/CD pipelines implement appropriate security controls including automated security scanning, secrets management, deployment approval workflows, and audit logging to ensure secure and controlled software delivery.",
  "guidance": "The CI/CD pipeline security evidence should demonstrate that:\ni) Automated security scanning is integrated into the pipeline including static code analysis, dependency vulnerability scanning, and container image scanning.\nii) Secrets and credentials are properly managed using secure secret management solutions and never hardcoded in code or configuration.\niii) Deployment approvals are required for production releases with documented approval from authorized personnel.\niv) Pipeline execution is logged and monitored with alerts for security events or unauthorized activities.\nv) Security testing gates prevent insecure code from progressing through the pipeline.",
