  "description": "Provide evidence that cloud infrastructure is configured with appropriate security controls including network security groups, encryption for data at rest and in transit, IAM role configurations, and multi-availability zone deployment for resilience.",
  "guidance": "The infrastructure security evidence should demonstrate that:\ni) Network security is implemented through properly configured security groups and firewalls that restrict traffic to necessary ports and protocols following least privilege principles.\nii) Data encryption is enabled for all data at rest using industry-standard algorithms (AES-256 or equivalent) and for data in transit using TLS 1.2 or higher.\niii) IAM roles and policies follow the principle of least privilege with appropriate segregation of duties.\niv) Production infrastructure is deployed across multiple availability zones to ensure high availability and resilience.\nv) Infrastructure is defined as code and version controlled to ensure consistent and auditable deployments.",
