  "description": "Provide evidence that source code repositories implement appropriate access controls including user permissions matrices, branch protection rules, and deployment environment access restrictions to ensure only authorized personnel can access and modify code.",
  "guidance": "The repository access control evidence should demonstrate that:\ni) Repository access follows the principle of least privilege with documented permission levels (read, write, admin) assigned based on job role and business need.\nii) Branch protection rules prevent unauthorized direct commits to production branches and enforce code review requirements.\niii) Deployment environment access is restricted with appropriate approval workflows for production deployments.\niv) Administrative access to repositories is limited to designated personnel.\nv) Repository permissions are reviewed periodically and access is revoked promptly when no longer needed.",
