  setup: |
    1. No additional setup required - works out of the box
    2. Optionally set DISABLE_THOUGHT_LOGGING=true to disable thought logging
    3. The server provides tools for structured problem-solving
  features:
    - Break down complex problems into manageable steps
    - Visual tracking of thought history
    - Dynamic revision and branching of thought processes
    - Adjustment as understanding deepens
  examples:
    - "Start a new thought sequence for problem analysis"
    - "Review and revise previous thoughts"
    - "Branch into alternative solutions"
    - "Track the evolution of understanding over time"
  use_cases:
    - Complex problem decomposition
    - Step-by-step reasoning
    - Decision tree exploration
    - Hypothesis testing and refinement

compatibility:
  platforms: [darwin, linux, windows]
  claude_versions: [desktop, code]
  min_ddx_version: "0.2.0"
  node_version: ">=16.0.0"

security:
  sandbox: recommended
  network_access: none
  file_access: none
  data_handling: "Thought sequences stored in memory during session"
  warnings:
    - "Thought sequences are not persisted between sessions"

verification:
  test_command: "Start a new thought sequence"
  expected_response: "Thought sequence initialized"
