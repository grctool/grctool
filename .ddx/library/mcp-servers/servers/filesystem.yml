  setup: |
    1. By default, $PWD gives access to the repository root directory
    2. Decide if additional directories are needed
    3. Add directory paths as command arguments:
       - During installation, you'll be prompted for paths
       - Or set FILESYSTEM_PATHS environment variable
    4. Consider using read-only mode for safety
    5. Paths must be absolute (not relative)
    6. $PWD will be replaced with the current working directory
  features:
    - "Read: List and read file contents"
    - "Write: Create, modify, delete files (if not read-only)"
    - "Directory operations: Create, remove directories"
  examples:
    - "List files in /Users/me/Projects"
    - "Read the contents of README.md"
    - "Create a new file called notes.txt"
    - "Search for Python files in the current directory"
  security_notes: |
    - Only grant access to necessary directories
    - Avoid granting access to system directories
    - Use read-only mode when write access isn't needed
    - Be cautious with home directory access

security:
  sandbox: critical
  network_access: none
  file_access: required

  warnings:
    - "Grants filesystem access - only allow necessary directories"
    - "Can modify/delete files if not in read-only mode"
    - "Avoid granting access to sensitive directories"
  recommendations:
    - "Use read-only mode when possible"
    - "Limit to specific project directories"
    - "Never grant access to system directories"
    - "Avoid home directory root access"
