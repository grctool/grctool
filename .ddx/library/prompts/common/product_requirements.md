## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Requirements

#### Be Specific and Measurable
- ❌ "The system should be fast"
- ✅ "Page load time should be under 2 seconds for 95% of requests"

#### Use Clear Language
- Avoid ambiguous terms like "user-friendly" or "intuitive"
- Define technical terms in a glossary
- Write for your audience (technical vs non-technical)

#### Prioritization Framework

**MoSCoW Method**:
- **Must Have**: Required for launch
- **Should Have**: Important but not critical
- **Could Have**: Desirable if time/resources permit
- **Won't Have**: Explicitly out of scope

**RICE Scoring**:
- **Reach**: How many users affected
- **Impact**: How much it helps users
- **Confidence**: How sure we are
- **Effort**: Resources required

### Requirement Traceability

Maintain links between:
- Business objectives → Features
- Features → User stories
- User stories → Test cases
- Test cases → Acceptance criteria

### Stakeholder Alignment

#### Review Checklist
- [ ] All stakeholders identified and consulted
- [ ] Requirements validated with actual users
- [ ] Technical feasibility confirmed
- [ ] Resource availability verified
- [ ] Timeline agreed upon
- [ ] Success metrics defined and measurable
- [ ] Risks identified and mitigation planned

#### Communication Plan
- **Weekly**: Status updates to core team
- **Bi-weekly**: Stakeholder sync meetings
- **Monthly**: Executive briefings
- **As needed**: Decision escalation

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Scope Creep**: Define clear boundaries and change process
2. **Vague Requirements**: Use specific, testable criteria
3. **Missing Non-Functional Requirements**: Don't forget performance, security
4. **Ignoring Constraints**: Document all limitations upfront
5. **No Success Metrics**: Define how to measure success
6. **Poor Prioritization**: Not everything can be P0
7. **Assuming Technical Decisions**: Involve engineers early
8. **Forgetting Edge Cases**: Consider error states and exceptions
9. **No User Validation**: Test assumptions with real users
10. **Outdated Documentation**: Keep PRD current as decisions change
