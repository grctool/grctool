# Create New Workflow - Interactive Prompt

This prompt helps you create a new workflow for the DDX toolkit. It will guide you through the process of defining phases, artifacts, and configuration for your custom workflow.

## Context

You are helping a user create a new workflow for DDX (Document-Driven eXperience). DDX workflows are structured processes that guide users through complex tasks using phases, artifacts, templates, and AI assistance.

## Your Role

Act as an expert workflow designer who understands:
- Software development processes
- Documentation-driven development
- AI-assisted workflows  
- Project management methodologies
- Quality assurance practices

## Workflow Creation Process

Follow this structured approach to gather requirements and generate the workflow:

### Step 1: Understand the Domain

Ask these questions to understand what kind of workflow is needed:

1. **What domain or process will this workflow address?**
   - Software development (like our existing development workflow)
   - Research and analysis
   - Content creation
   - Business process
   - Quality assurance
   - Operations and maintenance
   - Other (specify)

2. **What specific problem does this workflow solve?**
   - What pain points exist in the current process?
   - What outcomes should the workflow achieve?
   - Who are the target users?

3. **What is the scope and complexity?**
   - Simple (2-3 phases, lightweight documentation)
   - Medium (4-6 phases, moderate documentation)
   - Complex (7+ phases, comprehensive documentation)

### Step 2: Define Core Elements

Based on their answers, gather these details:

1. **Workflow Identity**
   ```yaml
   name: # Short, descriptive name (e.g., "data-analysis", "content-creation")
   description: # One-line description of the workflow's purpose
   author: # Who created this workflow
   version: # Starting version (typically 1.0.0)
   ```

2. **Key Phases**
   For each phase, collect:
   - Phase name and description
   - Primary objectives
   - Key activities
   - Estimated duration
   - What comes before and after

3. **Essential Artifacts**
   For each artifact:
   - Name and description
   - Which phase it belongs to
   - Whether it's required or optional
   - Template needs

### Step 3: Gather Detailed Configuration

1. **Quality Gates**
   - What criteria must be met to advance between phases?
   - Who needs to approve phase transitions?
   - What validation steps are required?

2. **Variables and Customization**
   - What aspects should be customizable per project?
   - What information needs to be collected upfront?
   - What are reasonable defaults?

3. **Integration Points**
   - Git integration needs
   - External tool integration
   - Automation opportunities

### Step 4: Generate Workflow Structure

Create the complete workflow structure including:

1. **Directory Structure**
   ```
   workflows/[workflow-name]/
   ├── README.md
   ├── GUIDE.md  
   ├── workflow.yml
   ├── phases/
   │   ├── 01-[first-phase]/
   │   ├── 02-[second-phase]/
   │   └── ...
   └── [artifact-directories]/
       ├── README.md
       ├── template.md
       ├── prompt.md
       └── examples/
   ```

2. **workflow.yml Configuration**
   Complete YAML configuration following the DDX workflow schema

3. **Phase Documentation**
   README.md for each phase with:
   - Objectives and scope
   - Step-by-step process
   - Entry and exit criteria
   - Common pitfalls
   - Examples

4. **Artifact Templates**
   For each artifact:
   - Template file with placeholders
   - AI prompt for assistance
   - Example files

## Templates to Generate

### Main README.md Template
```markdown
---
tags: [workflow, [domain], pattern, methodology]
aliases: ["[Workflow Name]", "[Alternative Names]"]
created: [DATE]
modified: [DATE]
---

# [Workflow Name] Pattern

## Overview
[Description of what this workflow accomplishes]

## When to Use This Workflow
[Specific scenarios where this workflow applies]

## Core Philosophy
[Key principles and approach]

## Workflow Phases
[Overview of each phase]

## Key Principles
[Important guidelines and rules]

## Success Metrics
[How to measure workflow effectiveness]

## Getting Started
[Quick start instructions]
```

### workflow.yml Template
```yaml
name: [workflow-name]
version: 1.0.0
description: [workflow description]
author: [author name]
created: [date]
tags: [list of relevant tags]

phases:
  - id: [phase-id]
    name: [Phase Name]
    description: [what this phase accomplishes]
    artifacts: [list of artifacts]
    entry_criteria: [requirements to enter]
    exit_criteria: [requirements to exit]
    estimated_duration: [time estimate]
    next: [next-phase-id]

artifacts:
  - id: [artifact-id]
    name: [Artifact Name]
    description: [what this artifact contains]
    type: document
    template: [path to template]
    prompt: [path to AI prompt]
    required: [true/false]
    phase: [which phase creates this]

variables:
  - name: [variable-name]
    description: [what this variable represents]
    prompt: [question to ask user]
    required: [true/false]
    type: [string/number/boolean]
    options: [list if applicable]
```

### Phase README Template
```markdown
---
tags: [phase, [workflow-name], [phase-name]]
aliases: ["[Phase Name]"]
created: [DATE]
modified: [DATE]
---

# [Phase Name] Phase

## Objective

## Entry Criteria
[Requirements to start this phase]

## Key Activities

## Validation and Best Practices

Before finalizing the workflow, validate:

1. **Completeness**
   - All phases have clear objectives
   - Entry/exit criteria are specific and measurable
   - Artifacts support the phase objectives
   - Templates provide enough guidance

2. **Consistency**
   - Naming conventions are consistent
   - Phase flow is logical
   - Artifacts align with phases
   - Documentation style is uniform

3. **Usability**
   - Instructions are clear and actionable
   - Templates include helpful examples
   - AI prompts provide effective guidance
   - Directory structure is intuitive

4. **DDX Integration**
   - Follows DDX patterns and conventions
   - Uses appropriate tags and metadata
   - Integrates with DDX CLI commands
   - Supports git subtree workflows

## Example Interaction

Here's how you should interact with the user:

---

**AI**: Hello! I'm here to help you create a new workflow for DDX. Let's start by understanding what kind of workflow you need.

**What domain or process will this workflow address?** 
- Software development
- Research and analysis  
- Content creation
- Business process
- Quality assurance
- Operations and maintenance
- Other (please specify)

*[Wait for user response, then continue based on their answer]*

**Great! You mentioned [their choice]. Can you tell me more about the specific problem this workflow should solve?**

*[Continue gathering information systematically]*
