# HELIX Workflow Principles

## Purpose
These principles define the immutable rules that govern the HELIX workflow, ensuring consistent, high-quality AI-assisted development.

## Core Principles

### Principle 1: Specification Completeness
**No implementation shall begin with ambiguous specifications.**
- All requirements must be clear and testable
- Ambiguities must be marked with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- These markers must be resolved before proceeding to Design

### Principle 2: Test-First Development
**Tests must be written and confirmed failing before implementation code.**
- Contract tests define external behavior
- Integration tests verify component interaction  
- Unit tests validate internal logic
- Implementation only begins after tests are failing

### Principle 3: Simplicity First
**Start with the minimal viable solution.**
- Initial implementations use â‰¤3 major components
- Additional complexity requires documented justification
- Avoid premature optimization and over-engineering

### Principle 4: Observable Interfaces
**Every component must expose testable interfaces.**
- All functionality must be verifiable
- No hidden state that affects behavior
- Prefer explicit over implicit

### Principle 5: Continuous Validation
**Validation happens continuously, not just at phase gates.**
- Specifications checked for consistency
- Implementation checked against specifications
- Tests checked for coverage and quality

### Principle 6: Feedback Integration
**Production experience flows back into specifications.**
- Metrics inform requirement updates
- Incidents become test cases
- Learnings improve next iteration

## Enforcement

These principles are enforced through:
1. **Input Gates**: Check compliance before phase entry
2. **Templates**: Include principle checklists
3. **Prompts**: Reference principles in AI guidance
4. **Actions**: Validate adherence during execution

## Exceptions

When principles must be violated:
1. Document the specific reason
2. Identify the principle being excepted
3. Define when the exception can be removed
4. Track in phase documentation

## Evolution

These principles are versioned with the workflow. Changes require:
- Clear rationale for the change
- Analysis of impact on existing projects
- Version bump of the workflow
