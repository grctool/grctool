## Test-to-Implementation Mapping

### Contract Tests → API Implementation

| Failing Test | Endpoint | Implementation Tasks | Effort |
|-------------|----------|---------------------|--------|
| POST /users test | /api/users | 1. Create controller<br>2. Add validation<br>3. Connect to service | 2h |
| GET /users/:id test | /api/users/:id | 1. Add route<br>2. Implement handler<br>3. Error handling | 1h |

### Integration Tests → Service Layer

| Failing Test | Service | Implementation Tasks | Effort |
|-------------|---------|---------------------|--------|
| UserService.create | UserService | 1. Create service class<br>2. Add database operations<br>3. Implement business rules | 3h |
| EmailService.send | EmailService | 1. Create email client<br>2. Add templates<br>3. Queue integration | 2h |

### Unit Tests → Business Logic

| Failing Test | Module | Implementation Tasks | Effort |
|-------------|--------|---------------------|--------|
| validateEmail | Validators | 1. Create validation function<br>2. Add regex patterns<br>3. Error messages | 30m |
| calculateTax | Calculators | 1. Implement formula<br>2. Handle edge cases<br>3. Precision handling | 1h |

## Development Workflow

### Daily Development Cycle

**Morning**:
1. Review test failures from previous day
2. Select next batch of tests (3-5 tests)
3. Plan implementation approach
4. Create feature branch

**Development**:
1. Run failing test to see error
2. Write minimal code to pass
3. Verify test passes
4. Refactor if needed
5. Run all related tests
6. Commit with descriptive message

**End of Day**:
1. Push completed work
2. Update progress tracking
3. Note blockers or issues
4. Plan tomorrow's tests

### Code Review Checkpoints

**Review Triggers**:
- [ ] Component complete (all related tests passing)
- [ ] End of each development phase
- [ ] Before major refactoring
- [ ] Complex implementation complete

**Review Checklist**:
- [ ] Tests are passing
- [ ] Code follows standards
- [ ] No unnecessary code
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Performance acceptable

## Refactoring Plan

### Refactoring Schedule

| Week | Focus Area | Refactoring Goals |
|------|------------|-------------------|
| Week 1 | Foundation | Extract common patterns |
| Week 2 | Services | Reduce duplication |
| Week 3 | API Layer | Improve error handling |
| Week 4 | Overall | Performance optimization |

### Refactoring Patterns

**Code Smells to Address**:
- [ ] Duplicated code → Extract method/class
- [ ] Long methods → Break into smaller functions
- [ ] Large classes → Split responsibilities
- [ ] Complex conditionals → Simplify logic
- [ ] Poor naming → Improve clarity

**Safety Measures**:
- Run full test suite before refactoring
- Refactor in small steps
- Commit after each successful refactoring
- Performance benchmarks remain met
