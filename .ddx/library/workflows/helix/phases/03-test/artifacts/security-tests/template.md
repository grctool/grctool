## Automated Security Testing

### Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
```yaml
sast_config:
  tool: "SonarQube"
  rules: "OWASP Top 10"
  scan_frequency: "on_commit"
  fail_build_on: "high_severity"
```

### Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
```yaml
dast_config:
  tool: "OWASP ZAP"
  target: "${STAGING_URL}"
  scan_type: "full"
  schedule: "nightly"
```

### Dependency Scanning
```yaml
dependency_scan:
  tool: "Snyk"
  scan_frequency: "daily"
  vulnerability_threshold: "medium"
  auto_fix: "enabled"
```

## Security Test Cases

### SEC-TC-001: Authentication Bypass Test
**Objective**: Verify that authentication cannot be bypassed
**Steps**:
1. Attempt to access protected resource without authentication
2. Modify authentication tokens
3. Use expired or invalid credentials
**Expected Result**: Access denied for all attempts

### SEC-TC-002: SQL Injection Test
**Objective**: Verify input validation prevents SQL injection
**Steps**:
1. Submit SQL injection payloads in all input fields
2. Test URL parameters, headers, and body content
3. Verify error messages don't reveal system information
**Expected Result**: All malicious inputs rejected safely

### SEC-TC-003: Encryption Validation Test
**Objective**: Verify sensitive data is properly encrypted
**Steps**:
1. Inspect database storage for unencrypted sensitive data
2. Monitor network traffic for unencrypted transmissions
3. Verify proper key management implementation
**Expected Result**: All sensitive data encrypted using approved methods
