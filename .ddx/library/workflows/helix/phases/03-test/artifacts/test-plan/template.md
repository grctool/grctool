## Coverage Requirements

### Coverage Targets

| Metric | Target | Minimum | Enforcement |
|--------|--------|---------|-------------|
| Line Coverage | 80% | 70% | CI blocks merge |
| Branch Coverage | 75% | 65% | CI blocks merge |
| Function Coverage | 85% | 75% | CI blocks merge |
| Critical Path | 100% | 100% | Required |

### Critical Paths

**P0 - Must Have Coverage**:
1. [User authentication flow]
2. [Core business transaction]
3. [Data persistence operations]
4. [Error handling paths]

**P1 - Should Have Coverage**:
1. [Secondary features]
2. [Admin functions]
3. [Reporting features]

**P2 - Nice to Have Coverage**:
1. [Edge cases]
2. [Rare scenarios]

## Handoff to Build Phase

### Deliverables for Build Team

1. **Test Suite** (failing tests ready)
   - All test files created
   - Tests are executable
   - Clear failure messages

2. **Test Documentation**
   - Test purpose and coverage
   - How to run tests
   - Expected failures

3. **Infrastructure**
   - Test environment ready
   - CI/CD configured
   - Mocks and fixtures prepared

### Build Phase Integration Points

**Test Execution**:
- Command: `npm test`
- Watch mode: `npm run test:watch`
- Coverage: `npm run test:coverage`

**Priority Guidance**:
1. Start with contract tests (external behavior)
2. Move to integration tests (component behavior)
3. Complete unit tests (internal logic)
4. Finish with E2E tests (user flows)

## Maintenance Plan

### Test Maintenance

**Regular Tasks**:
- Weekly: Review flaky tests
- Sprint: Update test data
- Monthly: Coverage analysis
- Quarterly: Framework updates

**Documentation Updates**:
- Keep test plan current
- Update coverage reports
- Document test patterns
- Share learnings
