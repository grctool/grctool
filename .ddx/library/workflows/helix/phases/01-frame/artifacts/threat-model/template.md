## Risk Assessment Matrix

### Risk Scoring
- **Impact**: 1 (Low) - 5 (Critical)
- **Likelihood**: 1 (Very Low) - 5 (Very High)
- **Risk Score**: Impact × Likelihood

### Risk Levels
- **Critical (20-25)**: Immediate action required
- **High (15-19)**: Action required within 30 days
- **Medium (10-14)**: Action required within 90 days
- **Low (5-9)**: Monitor and plan mitigation
- **Very Low (1-4)**: Accept risk or implement if cost-effective

### Top Risks Identified

| Risk ID | Threat | Impact | Likelihood | Risk Score | Priority |
|---------|--------|---------|------------|------------|----------|
| TM-I-001 | Sensitive data exposure | 5 | 3 | 15 | High |
| TM-E-002 | Administrative access abuse | 4 | 4 | 16 | High |

- [ ] Security controls mapped
- [ ] Assumptions and dependencies documented

### Validation Questions
1. **Completeness**: Have we identified all relevant threats?
2. **Accuracy**: Are the risk ratings appropriate?
3. **Feasibility**: Are the mitigations practical to implement?
4. **Coverage**: Do the controls address all identified threats?
5. **Prioritization**: Are we focusing on the highest risks first?

## Maintenance and Updates

### Review Schedule
- **Major Review**: Annually or after significant system changes
- **Minor Review**: Quarterly to assess new threats
- **Ad-hoc Review**: After security incidents or new threat intelligence

### Update Triggers
- New system components added
- Changes to data flows or trust boundaries
- New threat intelligence received
- Security incidents occurred
- Compliance requirements changed

### Change Management
- All threat model changes must be reviewed and approved
- Version control for threat model documents
- Communication of changes to relevant stakeholders
- Impact assessment for proposed changes
