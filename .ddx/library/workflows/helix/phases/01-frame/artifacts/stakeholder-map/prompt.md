# Stakeholder Map Generation Prompt

Create a comprehensive stakeholder map to identify, analyze, and plan engagement with all project stakeholders.

## Storage Location

Store the stakeholder map at: `docs/helix/01-frame/stakeholder-map.md`

This ensures the stakeholder analysis is readily accessible for communication planning and risk management.

## Purpose

The Stakeholder Map:
- Identifies all individuals and groups affected by the project
- Analyzes their influence and interest levels
- Defines engagement strategies
- Establishes communication plans
- Creates accountability through RACI matrix

## Key Principles

### 1. Comprehensive Identification
- Include both obvious and hidden stakeholders
- Consider internal and external parties
- Think about indirect impacts
- Don't forget negative stakeholders (those who may oppose)

### 2. Honest Assessment
- Be realistic about influence levels
- Acknowledge potential conflicts
- Identify both supporters and detractors
- Assess actual (not desired) engagement levels

### 3. Dynamic Document
- Stakeholder landscape changes over time
- Regular updates are essential
- Track changes in influence and interest
- Adjust strategies based on feedback

## Section Guidance

### Stakeholder Identification
Start broad, then prioritize:
1. **Brainstorm** all possible stakeholders
2. **Categorize** by influence and interest
3. **Prioritize** based on project impact
4. **Detail** key stakeholders thoroughly

### RACI Matrix
For each major activity:
- Only ONE person should be Accountable (A)
- At least ONE person must be Responsible (R)
- Limit Consulted (C) to those truly needed
- Keep Informed (I) list manageable

### Power/Interest Grid
Place stakeholders in quadrants:
- **High Power, High Interest**: Manage closely
- **High Power, Low Interest**: Keep satisfied
- **Low Power, High Interest**: Keep informed
- **Low Power, Low Interest**: Monitor

### Communication Planning
For each stakeholder group, define:
- **What** they need to know
- **When** they need to know it
- **How** to communicate (channel)
- **Who** is responsible for communication

## Common Stakeholder Categories

### Internal Stakeholders
- Executive sponsors
- Product owners
- Development team
- QA team
- Operations/DevOps
- Support team
- Sales and marketing
- Legal and compliance

### External Stakeholders
- End users/customers
- Partners/vendors
- Regulatory bodies
- Investors
- Community/open source contributors
- Competitors (indirect stakeholders)

## Engagement Strategies by Type

### Champions
- Leverage their influence
- Keep them highly engaged
- Use as project ambassadors
- Involve in key decisions

### Skeptics
- Address concerns directly
- Provide extra communication
- Involve in risk discussions
- Convert through early wins

### Gatekeepers
- Ensure early buy-in
- Maintain regular contact
- Address blockers quickly
- Formal agreements when needed

## Questions to Answer

1. **Identification**
   - Who has budget authority?
   - Who can stop the project?
   - Who will use the output?
   - Who provides resources?
   - Who influences users?

2. **Analysis**
   - What does each stakeholder want?
   - What are their concerns?
   - How much influence do they have?
   - What's their current attitude?

3. **Planning**
   - How should we engage each group?
   - What information do they need?
   - How often should we communicate?
   - Who manages each relationship?

## Quality Checklist

Before completing the stakeholder map:
- [ ] All stakeholder groups identified
- [ ] RACI matrix complete and consistent
- [ ] Communication plan is realistic
- [ ] Escalation path is clear
- [ ] Risks are identified and mitigated
- [ ] Contact information is current
- [ ] Engagement strategies are specific

## Red Flags to Avoid

### ‚ùå Common Mistakes

1. **Missing Hidden Stakeholders**
   - Forgetting operations team
   - Ignoring security team
   - Missing regulatory requirements

2. **Unrealistic Assessment**
   - Overestimating support
   - Underestimating resistance
   - Ignoring political dynamics

3. **Generic Strategies**
   - "Keep informed" without specifics
   - No tailored approach per stakeholder
   - Missing feedback mechanisms

4. **Static Document**
   - Not updating as project evolves
   - Ignoring stakeholder changes
   - Missing regular reviews

## Validation Questions

1. Can the project succeed without each "key" stakeholder?
2. Do we have a plan for each potential objection?
3. Is the communication plan sustainable?
4. Are the right people accountable?
5. Do we have stakeholder contact info?

## Using with AI

When working with AI to create this:
```bash
# Provide context about your organization
"Our company structure is..."
"Key decision makers include..."

# Be specific about constraints
"Budget approval requires..."
"We must comply with..."

# Include political dynamics
"There is tension between..."
"Previous projects failed because..."
```

Remember: Stakeholder management can make or break a project. Invest time in getting this right.
