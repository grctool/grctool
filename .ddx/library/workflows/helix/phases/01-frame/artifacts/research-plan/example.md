# Research Plan: CLI Workflow Management Pain Points

**Research Lead**: Product Manager
**Time Budget**: 2 weeks (40 hours)
**Created**: 2024-01-15
**Status**: Example

## Research Objectives

### Primary Research Questions

1. **Question 1**: What are the top 3 workflow bottlenecks for senior developers using CLI tools at startups (50-200 employees)?
   - **Why Important**: Understanding pain points will inform our core value proposition and feature prioritization
   - **Success Criteria**: Identify 3 specific, measurable pain points with 80% confidence based on 8+ interviews

2. **Question 2**: How do development teams currently share project configurations and templates across team members?
   - **Why Important**: This informs our sharing and collaboration feature requirements
   - **Success Criteria**: Document 3 current approaches with pros/cons and identify gaps in existing solutions

3. **Question 3**: What evidence exists that teams would adopt and pay for a CLI workflow management tool?
   - **Why Important**: Validates market demand and informs business model decisions
   - **Success Criteria**: Find 5+ teams expressing willingness to pay and establish price sensitivity range

### Knowledge Gaps

- **Gap 1**: User workflow pain points and current solutions
  - **Impact**: High - affects entire product direction
  - **Confidence**: Low - based only on assumptions

- **Gap 2**: Sharing and collaboration patterns in CLI tools
  - **Impact**: Medium - affects feature design
  - **Confidence**: Low - no direct evidence

- **Gap 3**: Market demand and pricing willingness
  - **Impact**: High - affects business viability
  - **Confidence**: Low - no validation data

## Research Scope

### In Scope
- [ ] Senior developers at startups (50-200 employees)
- [ ] Current CLI workflow management practices
- [ ] Pain points in existing tools and processes
- [ ] Collaboration and sharing behaviors
- [ ] Willingness to adopt new tools

### Out of Scope
- Large enterprise environments (>500 employees)
- Junior developer needs and workflows
- Non-startup organizational contexts
- Detailed technical implementation preferences

### Assumptions
1. Senior developers have decision-making influence on tool adoption
2. Startups have less rigid tool approval processes than enterprises
3. CLI tools are used regularly by our target audience

## Research Methods

### Method 1: User Interviews
- **Objective**: Understand current workflows, pain points, and collaboration patterns

- **Participants/Sources**: 8 senior developers at different startups
- **Duration**: 1 week for recruitment and interviews
- **Deliverable**: Interview summary report with key insights and quotes

### Method 2: Workflow Observation
- **Objective**: Observe actual vs. reported behavior in CLI tool usage
- **Approach**: Screen sharing sessions during typical development tasks
- **Participants/Sources**: 3 volunteers from interview participants
- **Duration**: 3 days for scheduling and observation
- **Deliverable**: Workflow analysis with friction points identified

### Method 3: Competitive Analysis
- **Objective**: Understand existing solutions, pricing, and market positioning
- **Approach**: Feature comparison, pricing analysis, user review analysis
- **Participants/Sources**: 5 major CLI tools and 3 emerging solutions
- **Duration**: 2 days for research and analysis
- **Deliverable**: Competitive landscape report with gap analysis

## Risk Assessment

### Research Risks
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| Insufficient participant recruitment | Medium | High | Over-recruit 12 candidates, offer flexible scheduling |
| Research timeline exceeded | Low | Medium | Build 2-day buffer into schedule |
| Inconclusive or conflicting findings | Medium | Medium | Focus on patterns across multiple data sources |
| Key stakeholder unavailable for validation | Low | Low | Schedule validation early, have backup reviewers |

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Participant Recruitment Risk**:
   - **Strategy**: Recruit through developer communities, offer $50 incentive
   - **Contingency**: Extend to remote developers, reduce interview length

2. **Timeline Risk**:
   - **Strategy**: Daily progress check-ins, prioritize high-impact activities
   - **Contingency**: Focus on primary research questions first
