## Overview

This document defines the security requirements that must be satisfied by the system to ensure adequate protection of data, users, and business operations. These requirements will inform security design decisions and testing strategies throughout the development lifecycle.

## Security User Stories

  - [ ] All user inputs validated server-side
  - [ ] Parameterized queries used for database access
  - [ ] Output encoding applied consistently
  - [ ] File upload restrictions implemented

### Audit & Monitoring

**SEC-008: Security Logging**

- **So that** security incidents can be detected and investigated
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] All authentication events logged
  - [ ] Privileged operations logged
  - [ ] Security-relevant configuration changes logged
  - [ ] Log integrity protection implemented

**SEC-009: Monitoring & Alerting**
- **As a** security team
- **I want** real-time security monitoring
- **So that** threats can be detected and responded to quickly
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Automated threat detection implemented
  - [ ] Security alerts configured with appropriate thresholds
  - [ ] Incident response procedures documented
  - [ ] Security metrics dashboards available
