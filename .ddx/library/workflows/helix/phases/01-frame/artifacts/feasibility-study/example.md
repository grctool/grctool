# Feasibility Study: DDx CLI Automation Platform

**Feasibility Lead**: Technical Product Manager
**Evaluation Timeframe**: 3 weeks
**Decision Deadline**: February 15, 2024
**Created**: January 25, 2024
**Status**: Example

## Executive Summary

### Project Overview
Development of a CLI automation platform that allows teams to share templates, workflows, and configurations across projects. The platform would provide a marketplace for reusable development patterns with AI-assisted customization.

### Feasibility Conclusion
**Overall Assessment**: CONDITIONALLY FEASIBLE

**Key Findings**:
- Technical implementation is achievable with Go-based CLI and git subtree architecture
- Market demand validated through developer interviews and competitive analysis
- Operational model straightforward for CLI tool distribution
- Resource requirements within available budget but timeline is aggressive

**Recommendation**: CONDITIONAL GO

### Decision Rationale
The project addresses a validated market need with proven technical approaches, but requires realistic timeline adjustment and additional developer hiring to ensure quality delivery.

## Technical Feasibility

### Technical Assessment: FEASIBLE

### Core Technical Requirements
| Requirement | Complexity | Risk Level | Notes |
|-------------|------------|------------|--------|
| CLI Framework (Cobra) | Low | Low | Proven technology, team has experience |
| Git Subtree Integration | Medium | Medium | Complex but well-documented approach |
| Template Processing | Low | Low | Standard text substitution |
| Repository Management | Medium | Low | Using existing git tools |
| Cross-platform Distribution | Medium | Medium | Requires CI/CD setup for multiple platforms |

### Technology Evaluation

#### Proposed Architecture
- **Architecture Pattern**: CLI with plugin-based templates
- **Key Technologies**: Go (Cobra framework), Git, YAML, Markdown
- **Integration Points**: Git repositories, CI/CD systems, package managers

#### Technical Constraints
- **Performance Requirements**: CLI commands <2 seconds, template application <30 seconds
- **Scalability Needs**: Handle 1000+ concurrent users, 100+ template repositories
- **Security Requirements**: No credential storage, use system git authentication
- **Compliance Needs**: Open source license compatibility

#### Technical Risks
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| Git subtree complexity | Medium | Medium | Create comprehensive test suite, expert consultation |
| Cross-platform distribution | Low | Medium | Use GitHub Actions for automated builds |
| Template variable conflicts | High | Low | Implement validation and conflict detection |

### Skills and Expertise Required
- **Available Skills**: Go development (2 developers), CLI tooling, Git workflows
- **Skill Gaps**: Advanced Git internals, cross-platform packaging
- **Learning Curve**: 2-4 weeks for Git subtree mastery
- **External Expertise Needed**: Git workflow consultant (1 week)

### Technical Conclusion
The technical approach is well-established with Go CLI frameworks and Git tooling. While git subtree adds complexity, it's a proven approach for managing distributed repositories. The main technical risk is ensuring robust handling of edge cases in git operations.

**Confidence Level**: High

| Resource | High | Team capacity, timeline pressure | High |

### Risk Mitigation Plan

#### High Priority Risks
1. **Risk**: Insufficient development capacity for 4-month timeline
   - **Mitigation**: Hire senior Go developer within 2 weeks
   - **Timeline**: Complete hiring by February 1
   - **Responsible**: Engineering Manager

2. **Risk**: Git subtree implementation complexity underestimated
   - **Mitigation**: Engage Git workflow consultant, build prototype first
   - **Timeline**: Consultant engaged by February 15, prototype by March 1
   - **Responsible**: Technical Lead

#### Risk Monitoring
- **Review Frequency**: Weekly team capacity reviews, monthly progress assessment
- **Key Indicators**: Development velocity, bug rates, hiring pipeline
- **Escalation Triggers**: >20% timeline deviation, critical skill unavailable >1 week

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: SaaS Platform Instead of CLI
- **Description**: Web-based template sharing platform
- **Pros**: Easier user onboarding, centralized management, better analytics
- **Cons**: Higher development complexity, ongoing hosting costs, less developer-friendly
- **Feasibility**: Feasible but requires 3x development resources

### Alternative 2: Plugin for Existing Tools (VS Code, etc.)
- **Description**: Build as extensions for existing IDEs/editors
- **Pros**: Existing user base, easier distribution, lower barrier to adoption
- **Cons**: Limited to specific tools, harder to monetize, fragmented experience
- **Feasibility**: Feasible but limits market opportunity

### Recommendation Rationale
CLI approach provides the best balance of developer appeal, technical simplicity, and business opportunity. While alternatives could work, they either increase complexity significantly or reduce market potential.

2. **Engage Git Expert**: Contract with consultant to de-risk git subtree implementation
3. **Adjust Timeline**: Either hire additional developer or extend timeline to 6 months
4. **Validate Pricing**: Complete pricing validation study before development begins

### Next Steps
1. **Immediate** (Next 1-2 weeks):
   - Approve hiring budget for senior Go developer
   - Begin recruiting process with target start date February 1
   - Engage git workflow consultant for 1-week assessment

2. **Short-term** (Next month):
   - Complete developer hiring and onboarding
   - Complete git subtree prototype and complexity validation
   - Finalize technical architecture and development plan

3. **Medium-term** (Next quarter):
