# Feasibility Study Generation Prompt

## Context
You are helping create a feasibility study for the Frame phase of the HELIX workflow. This artifact systematically evaluates project viability across multiple dimensions to support informed go/no-go decisions before significant resource commitment.

## Objective
Create a comprehensive feasibility assessment that evaluates technical buildability, business viability, operational sustainability, and resource adequacy. The study should provide evidence-based recommendations to support critical project decisions.

## Key Principles

### 1. Multi-Dimensional Analysis
Evaluate feasibility across four critical dimensions:
- **Technical**: Can we build it?
- **Business**: Should we build it?
- **Operational**: Can we run it?
- **Resource**: Can we afford it?

### 2. Evidence-Based Assessment
- Base all conclusions on verifiable evidence
- Separate facts from assumptions and opinions
- Quantify risks and opportunities where possible
- Document sources and reasoning for key judgments

### 3. Risk-Informed Decision Making
- Identify and assess key risks across all dimensions
- Propose mitigation strategies for manageable risks
- Clearly flag unacceptable or unmitigatable risks
- Consider risk tolerance in recommendations

### 4. Actionable Outcomes
- Provide clear go/no-go recommendations
- Define conditions for conditional approval
- Specify next steps for each recommendation
- Enable confident executive decision-making

## Input Analysis Framework

## Risk Assessment Integration

### Overall Risk Profile

Synthesize risks across all dimensions:

**Risk Level Determination**:
- **LOW RISK**: All dimensions feasible with manageable risks
- **MEDIUM RISK**: Some high-risk areas with viable mitigation
- **HIGH RISK**: Significant risks across multiple dimensions

**Critical Success Factors**:
- What must go right for the project to succeed?
- What are the key assumptions that must hold?
- What external dependencies exist?

### Risk Mitigation Strategy

For each critical risk:
1. **Risk Description**: Clear articulation of the risk
2. **Mitigation Approach**: Specific actions to reduce risk
3. **Contingency Plans**: Backup plans if mitigation fails
4. **Monitoring Indicators**: How to detect if risk is materializing

## Decision Framework Application

### Go/No-Go Criteria

**GO Decision Criteria**:
- All dimensions assessed as feasible
- Risk profile acceptable to stakeholders
- Resources adequate for success
- Clear value proposition validated
- Stakeholder alignment achieved

**CONDITIONAL GO Criteria**:
- Most dimensions feasible with some manageable risks
- Risk mitigation plans defined and approved
- Additional resources or conditions can address concerns
- Phased approach can reduce risk

**NO GO Criteria**:
- Any dimension assessed as not feasible
- Risk profile unacceptable to stakeholders
- Insufficient resources available
- Unclear or unvalidated value proposition
- Lack of stakeholder alignment

### Recommendation Formulation

Structure recommendations clearly:

**Primary Recommendation**: GO | CONDITIONAL GO | NO GO

**Rationale**: 2-3 paragraphs explaining:
- Key factors supporting the recommendation
- Critical assumptions underlying the assessment
- Primary risks and how they're addressed

**Conditions (for Conditional Go)**:
- Specific requirements that must be met
- Timeline for meeting conditions
- Responsibility for addressing conditions

**Next Steps**:
- Immediate actions (1-2 weeks)
- Short-term actions (1 month)
- Medium-term actions (1 quarter)

## Quality Standards

### Evidence Requirements

All assessments must be supported by:
- **Quantitative Data**: Numbers, metrics, measurements where possible
- **Qualitative Research**: Expert opinions, user feedback, market research
- **Comparable Examples**: Similar projects, industry benchmarks, case studies
- **Expert Validation**: Review by subject matter experts

### Analysis Quality Checks

Before finalizing, verify:
- [ ] All four feasibility dimensions thoroughly assessed
- [ ] Key assumptions clearly identified and validated
- [ ] Risks quantified with probability and impact assessments
- [ ] Mitigation strategies specific and actionable
- [ ] Recommendations clearly linked to analysis findings
- [ ] Alternative approaches considered and compared

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Analysis Pitfalls
- **Confirmation Bias**: Seeking evidence to support preconceived conclusions
- **Overconfidence**: Underestimating risks or complexity
- **Analysis Paralysis**: Getting stuck in analysis without reaching decisions
- **Single Dimension Focus**: Overweighting one dimension at expense of others

### Recommendation Pitfalls
- **False Precision**: Claiming more certainty than analysis supports
- **Risk Minimization**: Downplaying risks to get approval
- **Scope Creep**: Expanding scope during feasibility assessment
- **Resource Optimism**: Underestimating time, cost, or complexity

## Success Indicators

A high-quality feasibility study should:
- Enable confident go/no-go decisions
- Identify and address key risks proactively
- Provide realistic resource and timeline estimates
- Build stakeholder confidence in the assessment process
- Create clear accountability for recommendations

## Integration with HELIX Workflow

### Pre-Feasibility Study
- Should be triggered by significant uncertainty about project viability
- Requires basic problem statement and high-level solution approach
- Should have executive sponsorship and decision authority

### Post-Feasibility Study
- GO decision enables confident progression to detailed PRD development
- CONDITIONAL GO defines specific gates and conditions to meet
- NO GO prevents wasted investment in infeasible projects
- Risk assessment informs principles and constraints for design phase

### Decision Authority
- Feasibility study recommendations require executive approval
- Decision makers must have authority to commit resources
- Stakeholder alignment is critical for successful implementation

Remember: The purpose is to make better decisions, not to justify predetermined conclusions. A good feasibility study that prevents a bad investment is more valuable than a study that approves a marginal project.
