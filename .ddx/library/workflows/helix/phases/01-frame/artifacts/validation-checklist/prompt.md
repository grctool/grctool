# Validation Checklist Generation Prompt

Create a comprehensive validation checklist to ensure Frame phase completeness and quality before proceeding to Design.

## Storage Location

Store the validation checklist at: `docs/helix/01-frame/validation-checklist.md`

This ensures the validation is documented and can be referenced for phase gate reviews.

## Purpose

The Validation Checklist:
- Ensures all deliverables are complete
- Validates quality and consistency
- Confirms stakeholder alignment
- Identifies any gaps or issues
- Provides go/no-go decision framework

## Key Principles

### 1. Comprehensive Coverage
- Check every required artifact
- Validate cross-references
- Ensure consistency
- Verify completeness

### 2. Objective Assessment
- Use specific criteria
- Avoid subjective judgments
- Document evidence
- Note exceptions

### 3. Actionable Results
- Identify specific issues
- Assign remediation owners
- Set completion dates
- Define success criteria

## Validation Categories

### Documentation Validation
For each artifact, verify:
- **Existence**: Document exists in correct location
- **Completeness**: All sections are filled
- **Quality**: Content meets standards
- **Approval**: Required sign-offs obtained

### Content Validation
Check for:
- **Clarity**: Unambiguous language
- **Consistency**: No contradictions
- **Measurability**: Quantified metrics
- **Testability**: Verifiable requirements
- **Traceability**: Clear relationships

### Process Validation
Ensure:
- **Reviews**: Completed as required
- **Feedback**: Incorporated appropriately
- **Approvals**: Obtained from right people
- **Gates**: Entry/exit criteria met

## Checklist Structure

### 1. Artifact Checklist
For each Frame artifact:
- [ ] Document exists
- [ ] Location is correct
- [ ] Format follows template
- [ ] Content is complete
- [ ] Quality standards met
- [ ] Approved by stakeholders

### 2. Cross-Reference Validation
- [ ] PRD requirements → Feature specs
- [ ] Feature specs → User stories
- [ ] User stories → Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Risks → Mitigation plans
- [ ] Stakeholders → RACI assignments

### 3. Quality Gates
- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] in P0 items
- [ ] All P0 requirements specified
- [ ] Success metrics are measurable
- [ ] Risks have owners and plans
- [ ] Dependencies are identified

### 4. Stakeholder Validation
- [ ] Product Owner approval
- [ ] Technical Lead approval
- [ ] Sponsor sign-off
- [ ] Key stakeholder alignment

## Common Validation Issues

### Documentation Issues
- Missing documents
- Incomplete sections
- Outdated information
- Wrong file locations
- Broken references

### Content Issues
- Vague requirements
- Unmeasurable metrics
- Missing acceptance criteria
- Unidentified risks
- Unclear ownership

### Process Issues
- Missing approvals
- Skipped reviews
- Unresolved feedback
- Incomplete gates

## Validation Workflow

### Step 1: Self-Assessment
Team reviews checklist:
- Identify gaps
- Fix obvious issues
- Prepare for formal validation

### Step 2: Formal Validation
Validation team reviews:
- Check each item
- Document findings
- Identify blockers

### Step 3: Remediation
Address issues:
- Assign owners
- Set deadlines
- Track progress

### Step 4: Final Approval
Stakeholders sign off:
- Review validation results
- Approve or request changes
- Document decision

## Quality Checks

### Must Pass (Blocking)
- [ ] PRD approved
- [ ] P0 requirements specified
- [ ] Success metrics defined
- [ ] Stakeholder alignment
- [ ] Critical risks addressed

### Should Pass (Warning)
- [ ] All artifacts complete
- [ ] Examples provided
- [ ] Glossary defined
- [ ] Assumptions documented

### Nice to Have (Info)
- [ ] Lessons learned captured
- [ ] Process improvements identified
- [ ] Knowledge transfer prepared

## Validation Outcomes

### PASS
- All must-pass criteria met
- Most should-pass criteria met
- Ready for Design phase
- No blocking issues

### CONDITIONAL PASS
- Must-pass criteria met
- Some issues identified
- Specific conditions defined
- Timeline for resolution

### FAIL
- Must-pass criteria not met
- Blocking issues exist
- Remediation required
- Re-validation needed

## Using the Checklist

### For Validators
1. Review each item systematically
2. Look for evidence, not just checkmarks
3. Document specific issues found
4. Provide actionable feedback
5. Focus on what matters most

### For Teams
1. Use as self-assessment first
2. Address issues proactively
3. Prepare evidence in advance
4. Be honest about gaps
5. Focus on quality, not just completion

## Questions to Answer

1. **Completeness**
   - Are all required artifacts present?
   - Is critical information missing?
   - Are there unresolved clarifications?

2. **Quality**
   - Do artifacts meet standards?
   - Is information clear and testable?
   - Are metrics measurable?

3. **Alignment**
   - Do stakeholders agree?
   - Are expectations aligned?
   - Is scope understood?

4. **Readiness**
   - Can Design phase begin?
   - What risks remain?
   - What needs follow-up?

## Remember

Validation is about:
1. **Quality** over checkbox completion
2. **Learning** from gaps found
3. **Improvement** for next time
4. **Confidence** to proceed

A thorough validation prevents expensive fixes later and ensures the Design phase starts on solid ground.
