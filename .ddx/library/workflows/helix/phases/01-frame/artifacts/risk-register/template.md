## Executive Summary

[Brief overview of top risks and overall project risk profile]

- **Critical Risks**: [Number]
- **High Risks**: [Number]
- **Medium Risks**: [Number]
- **Low Risks**: [Number]
- **Overall Risk Level**: [Low | Medium | High | Critical]

## Risk Assessment Criteria

### Probability Scale
- **Very High (5)**: >80% chance of occurring
- **High (4)**: 60-80% chance
- **Medium (3)**: 40-60% chance
- **Low (2)**: 20-40% chance
- **Very Low (1)**: <20% chance

### Impact Scale
- **Critical (5)**: Project failure, >30% budget/schedule overrun
- **High (4)**: Major objectives compromised, 20-30% overrun
- **Medium (3)**: Some objectives affected, 10-20% overrun
- **Low (2)**: Minor impact, 5-10% overrun
- **Negligible (1)**: Minimal impact, <5% overrun

### Risk Score Matrix
```
Probability ↑
5 | 5  10 15 20 25
4 | 4  8  12 16 20
3 | 3  6  9  12 15
2 | 2  4  6  8  10
1 | 1  2  3  4  5
  +----------------→
    1  2  3  4  5  Impact
```

**Risk Levels**:
- **Critical** (20-25): Immediate action required
- **High** (12-19): Mitigation plan required
- **Medium** (6-11): Monitor and plan
- **Low** (1-5): Accept or monitor
