# Product Requirements Document - DDx CLI Toolkit

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Date**: January 14, 2024
**Status**: Approved
**Author**: Product Team

## Executive Summary

DDx (Document-Driven Development eXperience) is a CLI toolkit designed to help development teams share templates, prompts, and patterns across projects using AI assistance. Following a medical differential diagnosis metaphor, DDx enables teams to "diagnose" project issues, "prescribe" solutions through templates and patterns, and share improvements back to the community.

The toolkit addresses the growing need for standardized, AI-assisted development workflows while maintaining flexibility for project-specific customizations. By leveraging git subtree for version control and providing a curated library of templates and prompts, DDx accelerates development while ensuring consistency and quality.

## Problem Statement

### The Problem
Development teams struggle with:
- **Inconsistent project setup**: Each project reinvents configuration and structure
- **Knowledge silos**: Best practices and patterns aren't shared effectively
- **AI integration complexity**: Difficulty leveraging AI tools consistently
- **Template maintenance**: No systematic way to update and share improvements

### Current State
Teams currently:
- Copy-paste configurations between projects (error-prone)
- Maintain private template repositories (fragmented)
- Write ad-hoc AI prompts (inconsistent results)
- Struggle with contribution workflows (changes don't flow back)

### Opportunity
- **Market timing**: AI-assisted development is becoming mainstream
- **Technology enabler**: Git subtree provides robust versioning
- **Community need**: Developers seek standardized AI workflows

## Goals and Objectives

### Business Goals
1. Accelerate project initialization by 80%
2. Reduce configuration errors by 90%
3. Build a community of 1,000+ active users

### Success Metrics
| Metric | Target | Measurement Method | Timeline |
|--------|--------|-------------------|----------|
| Time to project setup | <5 minutes | CLI telemetry | Q2 2024 |
| Template reuse rate | >70% | Usage analytics | Q3 2024 |
| Community contributions | 50+ PRs/month | GitHub metrics | Q4 2024 |
| User satisfaction | NPS >50 | Quarterly survey | Q4 2024 |

### Non-Goals
- Not a full IDE or development environment
- Not a project generator (uses existing templates)
- Not a package manager replacement

## Users and Personas
