# Phase 01: Frame

The foundation phase where we define WHAT to build and WHY before considering HOW.

## Purpose

The Frame phase establishes the project's foundation by focusing on understanding the problem, defining business value, and aligning stakeholders on objectives. This phase deliberately avoids technical solutions to ensure we're solving the right problem for the right users.

## Key Principle

**Problem First, Solution Later**: Frame is about deeply understanding the problem space and user needs. Technical architecture and implementation details are intentionally deferred to the Design phase.

## Input Gates

Prerequisites to enter this phase (defined in `input-gates.yml`):
- **Problem or opportunity identified**: A clear business need or challenge requiring solution
- **Time allocated for analysis**: Dedicated time for thorough problem exploration

These gates ensure the team is ready to invest in proper framing before jumping to solutions.

## Exit Gates

Criteria that must be met before proceeding to Design phase (defined in `exit-gates.yml`):
- **PRD approved**: All stakeholders have signed off on requirements
- **P0 requirements specified**: Critical features have detailed specifications
- **Success metrics measurable**: Metrics have baselines, targets, and measurement methods
- **Principles established**: Technical and project constraints are documented
- **Risks assessed**: Major risks identified with mitigation strategies
- **Stakeholder alignment**: RACI matrix complete and communication plan established
- **Security requirements defined**: Security requirements documented and approved
- **Threat model completed**: Primary threats identified with mitigation strategies
- **Compliance requirements mapped**: Regulatory obligations identified and planned
- **Validation complete**: All artifacts reviewed and quality gates passed

The exit gates include automated validation rules and require formal approval from Product Owner, Technical Lead, Security Champion, and key stakeholders.

### Research Workflow Integration

#### When Research is Needed
Research artifacts should be considered when:

1. **High Uncertainty**: Significant unknowns about problem, users, or market
2. **High Stakes**: Large investment or strategic importance requires validation
3. **Novel Domain**: Unfamiliar problem space or market opportunity
4. **Assumption-Heavy**: Key decisions based on unvalidated assumptions
5. **Stakeholder Disagreement**: Different views on problem or approach

#### Research-First Process Flow
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Problem/Opportunity Identified] --> B{High Uncertainty or Risk?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Create Research Plan]
    B -->|No| D[Standard Frame Artifacts]
    C --> E[Execute Research]
    E --> F{Sufficient Clarity?}
    F -->|No| G[Additional Research or Pivot]
    F -->|Yes| H[Feasibility Study?]
    G --> F
    H -->|High Risk/Cost| I[Create Feasibility Study]
    H -->|Standard Risk| D
    I --> J{Go/No-Go Decision}
    J -->|Go/Conditional Go| D
    J -->|No-Go| K[Project Termination]
    D --> L[Continue to Standard Frame Process]
```

#### Integration with Standard Artifacts
Research findings directly inform standard Frame artifacts:

- **Research Plan → PRD**: User insights become personas, pain points become problem statements
- **Feasibility Study → Risk Register**: Risk assessment informs project risk management
- **Market Research → Stakeholder Map**: Market analysis identifies key stakeholders
- **User Research → User Stories**: Validated user needs become detailed user stories

#### Time Management
- **Research Plan**: 1-4 weeks maximum, time-boxed investigation
- **Feasibility Study**: 1-3 weeks, systematic analysis across dimensions
- **Decision Gates**: Clear criteria for when research is "good enough"
- **Integration Time**: Budget 1-2 weeks to integrate findings into standard artifacts

### Actions (Prompt-Only Operations)

The Frame phase focuses entirely on structured documentation (artifacts) and does not include arbitrary actions. All work items follow templates to ensure consistency, completeness, and alignment across stakeholders.

## Artifact Metadata

Each artifact directory includes a `meta.yml` file that formally defines:
- Dependencies on other artifacts
- Validation rules and requirements
- Output file locations
- Required variables and conditionals
- Workflow integration points
- Quality checks and automated validation

This metadata enables automated validation, dependency tracking, and quality assurance across the workflow. The meta.yml files ensure consistency and completeness while providing clear guidance for both human teams and AI assistants.

## Workflow Principles

This phase operates under the HELIX workflow principles, emphasizing:
- **Human-AI Collaboration**: Humans provide vision and priorities; AI assists with documentation
- **Phase Separation**: Clear boundaries between Frame (what/why) and Design (how)
- **Validation Gates**: Input gates ensure readiness; exit criteria ensure completeness
- **Iterative Refinement**: Continuous improvement through feedback loops

The workflow's overarching principles guide all decisions and ensure consistency across phases.

## File Organization

### Structure Overview
- **Artifact Definitions**: `workflows/helix/phases/01-frame/artifacts/`
  - Contains templates, prompts, and examples for each artifact
  - Defines the structure and guidance for artifact creation

- **Generated Outputs**: `docs/helix/01-frame/`
  - Where completed artifacts are stored in the project
  - Makes documentation easily accessible to all stakeholders
  - Features organized by FEAT-XXX identifier
  - User stories organized by US-XXX identifier

This separation keeps workflow templates reusable while placing outputs where they're most useful in the project structure.

## Quality Gates

Before proceeding to Design phase, ensure:

### Completeness Checklist
- [ ] PRD approved by stakeholders
- [ ] Success metrics are specific and measurable
- [ ] All P0 requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] User personas validated with actual user data
- [ ] Principles document reflects technical constraints
- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain

#### Research Completion (When Applicable)
- [ ] Research plan objectives achieved with evidence
- [ ] Key assumptions validated or invalidated
- [ ] User needs confirmed through research data
- [ ] Market opportunity validated with concrete evidence
- [ ] Feasibility study completed with go/no-go decision
- [ ] Research findings integrated into PRD and requirements

### Validation Questions
1. **Problem Clarity**: Can a new team member understand what problem we're solving?
2. **User Focus**: Are we designing for specific, validated personas?
3. **Success Definition**: Do we know exactly how to measure success?
4. **Scope Boundaries**: Is it clear what we're NOT building?
5. **Risk Awareness**: Have we identified and planned for major risks?

## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ Avoid These Mistakes

1. **Solution Bias**
   - Bad: "Users need a dashboard with real-time updates"
   - Good: "Users can't track project progress effectively"

2. **Vague Metrics**
   - Bad: "Improve user experience"
   - Good: "Reduce task completion time from 5 minutes to 2 minutes"

3. **Everyone User**
   - Bad: "This is for all developers"
   - Good: "Primary: Senior backend engineers at startups (50-200 employees)"

4. **Feature Creep**
   - Bad: Adding "nice to have" features to P0
   - Good: Ruthless prioritization with clear P0/P1/P2 boundaries

5. **Missing NFRs**
   - Bad: Only listing functional features
   - Good: Defining performance, security, and scalability requirements

## Success Criteria

The Frame phase is complete when:

1. **Alignment Achieved**: All stakeholders agree on problem and approach
2. **Metrics Defined**: Success is measurable with specific targets
3. **Users Identified**: Personas are based on real user research
4. **Scope Clear**: P0 requirements fit within timeline and resources
5. **Risks Acknowledged**: Major risks have mitigation strategies
6. **Documentation Complete**: All artifacts reviewed and approved

## Next Phase: Design

Once Frame is validated, proceed to Design phase where you'll:
- Create technical architecture based on requirements
- Design API contracts and interfaces
- Develop implementation plan
- Specify test strategies

Remember: Frame defines the "what" and "why" - Design will define the "how".

## Tips for Success

1. **Resist Solutioning**: When technical solutions arise, note them for Design phase
2. **Talk to Users**: Base personas on actual user interviews, not assumptions
3. **Quantify Everything**: Use numbers for metrics, timelines, and impact
4. **Document Decisions**: Capture why certain choices were made
5. **Iterate Quickly**: Use feedback loops to refine artifacts

## Using AI Assistance

When working with AI assistants during Frame:

### Standard Frame Artifacts
```bash
# Generate initial PRD from project idea
ddx apply prompts/helix/frame/prd

# Validate user stories for completeness
ddx apply prompts/helix/frame/user-stories

# Check specification for gaps
ddx apply prompts/helix/frame/specification
```

### Research Artifacts (When Uncertainty Exists)
```bash
# Create research plan for unknown requirements
ddx apply prompts/helix/frame/research-plan

# Conduct feasibility analysis
ddx apply prompts/helix/frame/feasibility-study

# Synthesize research findings into insights
ddx apply prompts/helix/frame/research-synthesis

# Validate assumptions with evidence
ddx apply prompts/helix/frame/assumption-testing
```

### AI Research Capabilities
AI assistants excel at:
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying trends across user interviews and market data
- **Synthesis**: Combining findings from multiple research sources
- **Gap Analysis**: Spotting missing research areas or unvalidated assumptions
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifying potential risks across technical, business, and market dimensions
- **Competitive Analysis**: Analyzing competitor information and identifying market gaps

The AI can help ensure completeness but human judgment is essential for business decisions, priority setting, and stakeholder alignment.
