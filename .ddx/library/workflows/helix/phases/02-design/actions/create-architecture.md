# HELIX Action: Create Architecture

You are a HELIX Design phase executor tasked with creating a comprehensive system architecture that translates requirements into a robust, scalable technical foundation. Your role is to design the structural elements that will guide implementation.

## Action Purpose

Design the system architecture, including components, interfaces, data flow, and technology choices that will support all functional and non-functional requirements.

## When to Use This Action

- After Frame phase requirements are approved
- When technical design must be established
- Before detailed implementation planning begins
- When architectural decisions need documentation

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Requirements specification approved
- [ ] Technical constraints identified
- [ ] Technology evaluation completed (if needed)
- [ ] Architecture stakeholders available
- [ ] Non-functional requirements quantified

## Action Workflow

### 1. Architecture Analysis

**Requirements Analysis for Architecture**:
```
üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURE DESIGN SESSION

1. FUNCTIONAL DECOMPOSITION
   - What are the major functional areas?
   - How do these areas interact?
   - What are the core business entities?
   - What processes need to be supported?

2. NON-FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS
   - Performance requirements and bottlenecks
   - Scalability needs and growth patterns
   - Security requirements and threat model
   - Availability and reliability needs
   - Integration requirements

3. CONSTRAINT ANALYSIS
   - Technology constraints and standards
   - Infrastructure limitations
   - Budget and resource constraints
   - Timeline and delivery constraints
   - Compliance and regulatory requirements

4. QUALITY ATTRIBUTE PRIORITIZATION
   - Performance vs. Maintainability trade-offs
   - Security vs. Usability balance
   - Scalability vs. Simplicity decisions
   - Flexibility vs. Performance choices
```

- [ ] Technology choices are justified and documented
- [ ] Component responsibilities are clearly defined
- [ ] Interfaces between components are specified
- [ ] Data flow and storage strategy is documented

## Integration with Design Phase

This action supports the Design phase by:
- **Enabling API Design**: Architecture informs interface specifications
- **Supporting Solution Design**: Provides technical foundation for detailed design
- **Informing Technology Spikes**: Identifies areas needing proof-of-concept work
- **Guiding Security Design**: Establishes security architecture patterns

## Architecture Principles

### SOLID Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one reason to change
- **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Subtypes must be substitutable for base types
- **Interface Segregation**: Clients shouldn't depend on unused interfaces
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### Distributed System Principles
- **Fault Tolerance**: Design for failure
- **Eventual Consistency**: Accept and design for consistency delays
- **Idempotency**: Operations can be safely retried
- **Circuit Breaker**: Protect against cascading failures
- **Bulkhead**: Isolate critical resources

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

‚ùå **Over-Engineering**: Building for theoretical future needs
‚ùå **Under-Engineering**: Ignoring known scalability requirements
‚ùå **Technology Bias**: Choosing familiar over appropriate
‚ùå **Tight Coupling**: Creating dependencies that limit flexibility
‚ùå **Ignoring Non-Functionals**: Focusing only on functional architecture
‚ùå **No Documentation**: Failing to document architectural decisions

## Success Criteria

This action succeeds when:
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive architecture addresses all requirements
- ‚úÖ Technology choices are appropriate and justified
- ‚úÖ Component design enables maintainable implementation
- ‚úÖ Data architecture supports performance and scalability needs
- ‚úÖ Security architecture addresses identified threats
- ‚úÖ Architecture is documented and reviewable
- ‚úÖ Team understands and agrees on architectural approach
- ‚úÖ Foundation is established for detailed design work

Remember: Architecture is about making the right trade-offs early to prevent expensive changes later.
