# Proof of Concept Generation Prompt

## Context
You are helping create a proof of concept (PoC) for the Design phase of the HELIX workflow. A PoC is a more substantial technical validation than a spike, involving building a minimal but working implementation to validate technical approaches, architecture patterns, and integration strategies before committing to full development.

## Objective
Create a functional implementation that demonstrates the viability of key technical concepts, validates architectural approaches, and provides concrete evidence for production implementation decisions. The PoC should be substantial enough to reveal practical implementation challenges while remaining focused on validation rather than production delivery.

## Key Principles

### 1. End-to-End Validation
- Demonstrate complete workflows, not just isolated components
- Validate data flow from input to output
- Test key integration points and system boundaries
- Prove the concept works in realistic scenarios

### 2. Production-Informed Implementation
- Use production-like technologies and patterns
- Implement with production constraints in mind
- Address key non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability)
- Identify what would be needed for production readiness

### 3. Evidence-Based Assessment
- Measure performance characteristics objectively
- Document integration complexity and challenges
- Collect concrete data about implementation effort
- Provide quantitative evidence for decision-making

### 4. Risk Mitigation Focus
- Address highest-risk technical assumptions
- Validate novel or unproven approaches
- Test complex integration scenarios
- Identify potential production issues early

## PoC Planning Framework

### Concept Validation Scope

Define exactly what technical concept needs validation:

**Architecture Validation**:
- Does the proposed system architecture work end-to-end?
- Can components integrate as designed?
- Do performance characteristics meet requirements?
- Is the approach scalable and maintainable?

**Technology Validation**:
- Can the chosen technology stack deliver required functionality?
- How complex is integration with existing systems?
- What are the performance and scalability characteristics?
- Are there hidden technical risks or limitations?

**Integration Validation**:
- Can the system integrate with required external services?
- How robust is data flow between components?
- What is the complexity of maintaining integration points?
- Are there compatibility or version conflicts?

**User Experience Validation**:
- Does the proposed user interaction model work effectively?
- Can users accomplish key workflows intuitively?
- What are the performance and usability characteristics?
- Are there workflow bottlenecks or friction points?

### Success Criteria Definition

Establish clear, measurable criteria for PoC success:

**Functional Success**:
- Core workflows operate end-to-end
- Key features demonstrate intended behavior
- Integration points function correctly
- Error handling works for common failure modes

**Performance Success**:

- Capture both positive and negative findings

## Success Indicators

A successful PoC should:
- Demonstrate end-to-end functionality of core concept
- Provide quantitative evidence for performance and scalability
- Identify practical implementation challenges and solutions
- Generate clear, actionable recommendations for production development
- Create reusable artifacts and knowledge for the team

## Integration with HELIX Workflow

### Pre-PoC Requirements
- Clear technical concept requiring validation
- Defined success criteria and decision points
- Sufficient time and resource allocation
- Stakeholder commitment to act on findings

### Post-PoC Actions
- Update solution design based on findings
- Refine architecture and technology choices
- Adjust implementation timeline and resource plans
- Document architectural decisions (ADRs)
- Communicate findings to stakeholders

### Decision Integration
PoC findings should directly inform:
- Go/no-go decisions for technical approaches
- Architecture and technology choices
- Implementation planning and resource allocation
- Risk mitigation strategies and contingency plans

Remember: The goal is informed decision-making through working implementation. A good PoC provides evidence to make confident choices about production development.
