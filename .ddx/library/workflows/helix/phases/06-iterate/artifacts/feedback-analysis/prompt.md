## Storage Location

Store the analysis at: `docs/helix/06-iterate/feedback-analysis.md`

Update this analysis weekly or after significant feedback volumes to maintain pulse on user satisfaction.

## Analysis Purpose

The Feedback Analysis is an **AI-enhanced synthesis tool** that:
- Aggregates feedback from multiple channels
- Identifies patterns and trends in user sentiment
- Prioritizes improvements based on impact
- Predicts churn risks and satisfaction drivers
- Connects user voice to product decisions

## Key Principles

### 1. Patterns Over Individual Comments
- Look for recurring themes across feedback
- Weight by frequency and user segment value
- Identify root causes behind surface complaints

### 2. Sentiment as Leading Indicator
- Track sentiment trends before they impact metrics
- Correlate sentiment with user behavior
- Predict future NPS/CSAT movements

### 3. Actionable Over Interesting
- Every insight must drive a decision
- Prioritize by user impact and business value
- Connect feedback to specific features/changes

### 4. Segmented Over Averaged
- Different user segments have different needs
- Personalize improvements by segment
- Avoid one-size-fits-all solutions

## Data Collection Sources

### Primary Channels
- **In-app feedback**: Surveys, feedback widgets
- **Support tickets**: Email, chat, phone transcripts
- **App store reviews**: iOS, Android, desktop
- **Social media**: Twitter/X, Reddit, LinkedIn
- **User interviews**: Transcripts and notes
- **Community forums**: Discord, Slack, discussion boards
- **NPS/CSAT surveys**: Scores and comments

### Collection Best Practices
- Normalize data formats across channels
- Preserve context and metadata
- Track feedback source and user segment
- Maintain temporal ordering
- Handle multiple languages appropriately

## AI Analysis Techniques

### Sentiment Analysis
```python
# Multi-level sentiment scoring:
- Document level: Overall feedback sentiment
- Aspect level: Sentiment per feature/topic
- Temporal: Sentiment evolution over time
- Comparative: Sentiment vs competitors
```

### Topic Modeling
- **LDA**: Discover hidden topic structures
- **BERT**: Contextual topic understanding
- **Clustering**: Group similar feedback
- **Keyword Extraction**: Identify key terms

### Priority Scoring Algorithm
```python
priority_score = (
    user_segment_value * 0.3 +
    frequency_of_mention * 0.25 +
    sentiment_impact * 0.2 +
    business_alignment * 0.15 +
    implementation_feasibility * 0.1
)
```

### Churn Prediction
- Identify language patterns of churning users
- Correlate feedback with usage decline
- Score users by churn risk
- Recommend retention interventions

## Remember

Feedback Analysis is about **turning user voice into product value**. It should answer:
1. What do users love and hate?
2. What should we build next?
3. Who is at risk of churning?
4. How are we trending?
5. What blindspots do we have?

Great feedback analysis creates empathy, drives priorities, and keeps the team connected to users.
