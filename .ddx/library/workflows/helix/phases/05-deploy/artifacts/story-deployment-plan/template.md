# Deployment Plan: DP-XXX-[story-name]

*Rollout strategy for story-level deployment*

## Story Reference

**User Story**: [[US-XXX-[story-name]]]
**Implementation Plan**: [[IP-XXX-[story-name]]]
**Test Results**: All tests passing in build phase

## Deployment Strategy

**Approach**: [Canary/Blue-Green/Rolling/Feature Flag]
**Risk Level**: [Low/Medium/High]
**Rollback Time**: [X minutes]

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Code Readiness
- [ ] All tests passing in CI/CD
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Security scan completed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Documentation updated

### Infrastructure Readiness
- [ ] Database migrations prepared
- [ ] Configuration updated
- [ ] Secrets/credentials configured
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured
- [ ] Rollback plan tested

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Pre-Deployment
```bash
# Backup current state
make backup-prod

# Verify environment
make verify-env ENV=production
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Staging
```bash
# Deploy to staging
make deploy ENV=staging VERSION=[version]

# Run smoke tests
make smoke-test ENV=staging
```

### Step 3: Production Deployment

#### Option A: Feature Flag Deployment
```yaml
feature_flags:
  US-XXX-feature:
    enabled: false
    rollout_percentage: 0
```

Gradual rollout:
1. Enable for internal users (0.1%)
2. Increase to 1% of users
3. Monitor for 1 hour
4. Increase to 10%
5. Monitor for 4 hours
6. Increase to 50%
7. Monitor overnight
8. Full rollout (100%)

#### Option B: Canary Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to canary instance
make deploy-canary VERSION=[version]

# Route 5% traffic to canary
make route-traffic CANARY=5

# Monitor and increase gradually
make route-traffic CANARY=25
make route-traffic CANARY=50
make route-traffic CANARY=100
```

## Monitoring Plan

### Key Metrics to Watch
- **Application Metrics**
  - Error rate: < 0.1%
  - Response time (p95): < 200ms
  - Success rate: > 99.9%

- **Business Metrics**
  - User engagement
  - Feature adoption rate
  - Conversion metrics

### Alerts Configuration
```yaml
alerts:
  - name: high_error_rate
    condition: error_rate > 1%
    action: page_on_call

  - name: slow_response
    condition: p95_latency > 500ms
    action: notify_team
```

## Rollback Plan

### Automatic Rollback Triggers
- Error rate > 5%
- Response time > 1000ms (p95)
- Success rate < 95%

### Manual Rollback Procedure
```bash
# Immediate rollback
make rollback ENV=production

# Verify rollback
make verify-rollback

# Notify team
make notify-rollback
```

### Data Rollback (if needed)
```sql
-- Revert schema changes
ALTER TABLE [table] DROP COLUMN [new_column];

-- Restore data state
UPDATE [table] SET [field] = [old_value] WHERE [condition];
```

## Post-Deployment Validation

### Smoke Tests
```bash
# Core functionality
curl -X GET https://api.example.com/health

# Story-specific feature
curl -X POST https://api.example.com/api/v1/[resource]
```

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] Feature accessible to target users
- [ ] No increase in error rates
- [ ] Performance within targets
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards updated
- [ ] Documentation published

## Communication Plan

### Pre-Deployment
- **Team Notification**: 1 hour before
- **Stakeholder Update**: Morning of deployment

### During Deployment
- **Status Updates**: Every 30 minutes
- **Issue Escalation**: Immediate

### Post-Deployment
- **Success Notification**: Upon completion
- **Metrics Report**: Next day

## Success Criteria

Deployment is successful when:
- [ ] Feature deployed to production
- [ ] All smoke tests passing
- [ ] Error rates normal
- [ ] Performance metrics stable
- [ ] User feedback positive
- [ ] No rollback needed

## Rollout Schedule

| Phase | Date/Time | Action | Success Criteria |
|-------|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| Staging | [Date] 10:00 | Deploy to staging | Tests pass |
| Canary | [Date] 14:00 | Deploy to 1% | No errors |
| Partial | [Date] 16:00 | Increase to 10% | Metrics stable |
| Full | [Date+1] 10:00 | 100% rollout | All users have access |
