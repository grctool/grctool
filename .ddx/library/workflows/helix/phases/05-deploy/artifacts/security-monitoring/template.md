# Security Monitoring Setup

**Project**: [Project Name]
**Date**: [Creation Date]
**Security Operations**: [Name]

## Monitoring Architecture

### Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
- **Platform**: [Splunk, Azure Sentinel, AWS Security Hub]
- **Data Sources**: Application logs, system logs, network logs, security tools
- **Retention**: Security events retained for [X] months
- **Alerting**: Real-time alerts for critical security events

### Log Collection and Analysis
- **Collection**: Centralized logging via [tool/service]
- **Parsing**: Structured logging with security event categorization
- **Analysis**: Automated correlation and anomaly detection
- **Storage**: Encrypted log storage with integrity protection

## Security Alerts Configuration

### Authentication Alerts
- [ ] Multiple failed login attempts (threshold: 5 in 5 minutes)
- [ ] Successful login from new location/device
- [ ] Administrative account usage outside business hours
- [ ] MFA bypass attempts
- [ ] Account lockout events

### Authorization Alerts
- [ ] Privilege escalation attempts
- [ ] Access to sensitive resources
- [ ] Administrative function usage
- [ ] Unusual permission grant/revoke activities
- [ ] Cross-tenant data access attempts

### Data Protection Alerts
- [ ] Large data downloads/exports
- [ ] Unusual database query patterns
- [ ] Encryption key access outside normal patterns
- [ ] Data classification policy violations
- [ ] Backup/restore operations

### Infrastructure Alerts
- [ ] Unusual network traffic patterns
- [ ] System configuration changes
- [ ] New service/application deployments
- [ ] Resource utilization anomalies
- [ ] Security tool status changes

## Incident Response Integration

### Alert Triage
- **Priority Levels**: Critical (immediate), High (1 hour), Medium (4 hours), Low (24 hours)
- **Escalation Matrix**: Security team → Manager → CISO
- **Communication Channels**: [Slack, PagerDuty, Email]
- **Response Procedures**: Documented playbooks for common scenarios

### Investigation Tools
- [ ] Log analysis and search capabilities
- [ ] Network traffic analysis
- [ ] Endpoint detection and response
- [ ] Threat intelligence integration
- [ ] Forensic investigation tools

## Compliance Monitoring

### Audit Trail Requirements
- [ ] All user actions logged with timestamps
- [ ] Administrative changes tracked and attributed
- [ ] Data access events recorded
- [ ] System changes audited
- [ ] Log integrity verification

### Regulatory Reporting
- [ ] GDPR breach notification (72-hour requirement)
- [ ] Industry-specific incident reporting
- [ ] Compliance dashboard with KPIs
- [ ] Regular compliance reports generated
- [ ] Evidence collection for audits

## Dashboard and Metrics

### Security Operations Dashboard
- Active security incidents
- Security alert volumes and trends
- System security health indicators
- Threat intelligence feeds
- Compliance status indicators

### Key Performance Indicators
- Mean time to detect (MTTD) security incidents
- Mean time to respond (MTTR) to security alerts
- False positive rate for security alerts
- Security control effectiveness metrics
- User security awareness metrics

## Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment Setup
- [ ] SIEM/monitoring platform configured
- [ ] Log collection agents deployed
- [ ] Security rules and correlation logic implemented
- [ ] Alert thresholds and notification channels configured
- [ ] Dashboard and reporting setup completed

### Post-Deployment Validation

- [ ] Security alerts triggering appropriately
- [ ] Dashboard metrics updating in real-time
- [ ] Incident response procedures tested
- [ ] Integration with other security tools validated

### Ongoing Operations
- [ ] 24/7 security operations center (SOC) coverage
- [ ] Regular rule tuning and threshold adjustment
- [ ] Threat intelligence feed updates
- [ ] Security monitoring tool maintenance
- [ ] Staff training on monitoring tools and procedures
