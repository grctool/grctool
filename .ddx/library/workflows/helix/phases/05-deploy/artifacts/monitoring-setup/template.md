# Monitoring Setup

## Overview
Monitoring configuration for {{ project_name }} production deployment.

## Metrics Collection

### Application Metrics
- **Response Time**: Track 50th, 95th, 99th percentiles
- **Throughput**: Requests per second by endpoint
- **Error Rate**: 4xx and 5xx responses by type
- **Business Metrics**: [Define specific business KPIs]

### System Metrics
- **CPU Usage**: Average and peak utilization
- **Memory**: Heap usage, garbage collection
- **Disk I/O**: Read/write operations, latency
- **Network**: Bandwidth, connection pool usage

### Custom Metrics
```yaml
metrics:
  - name: [metric_name]
    type: counter|gauge|histogram
    description: [what this measures]
    labels: [dimensions for aggregation]
```

## Alerting Rules

### Critical Alerts (Page immediately)
| Alert | Condition | Action |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Service Down | Health check fails 3x in 1 min | Page on-call |
| High Error Rate | 5xx errors > 1% for 5 min | Page on-call |
| Data Loss Risk | Queue backup > 10K messages | Page on-call |

### Warning Alerts (Notify team)
| Alert | Condition | Action |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| High Latency | p95 > 1s for 10 min | Slack notification |
| Memory Pressure | Heap > 80% for 15 min | Email team |
| Disk Space | < 20% free space | Create ticket |

### Info Alerts (Log for review)
- Deployment completed
- Configuration changed
- Scaling events
- Backup completed

## Dashboards

### Operations Dashboard
- Service health status
- Request rate and latency
- Error rate by type
- Active users/sessions
- Database performance

### Business Dashboard
- User engagement metrics
- Feature adoption rates
- Transaction volumes
- Revenue metrics
- Conversion funnel

### Technical Dashboard
- Resource utilization
- Dependency health
- Cache hit rates
- Queue depths
- Background job status

## Log Aggregation

### Log Levels
- **ERROR**: System errors requiring investigation
- **WARN**: Potential issues, degraded performance
- **INFO**: Normal operations, state changes
- **DEBUG**: Detailed diagnostic information

### Structured Logging
```json
{
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
  "level": "ERROR|WARN|INFO|DEBUG",
  "service": "service-name",
  "trace_id": "correlation-id",
  "user_id": "if-applicable",
  "message": "human-readable",
  "context": {}
}
```

### Log Retention
- Production: 30 days hot, 1 year cold
- Staging: 7 days
- Development: 1 day

## Health Checks

### Liveness Check
```
GET /health/live
Response: 200 OK
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601"
}
```

### Readiness Check
```
GET /health/ready
Response: 200 OK | 503 Service Unavailable
{
  "status": "ready|not-ready",
  "checks": {
    "database": "ok|failed",
    "cache": "ok|failed",
    "dependencies": "ok|degraded|failed"
  }
}
```

## Tracing

### Distributed Tracing
- Trace critical user journeys
- Track cross-service calls
- Measure end-to-end latency
- Identify bottlenecks

### Trace Sampling
- Production: 1% baseline, 100% for errors
- Staging: 10% baseline
- Development: 100%

## SLI/SLO/SLA Tracking

### Service Level Indicators (SLI)
- Availability: Successful requests / Total requests
- Latency: Requests under 1s / Total requests
- Quality: Successful transactions / Total transactions

### Service Level Objectives (SLO)
- Availability: 99.9% monthly
- Latency: 95% of requests < 1s
- Quality: 99% transaction success

### Error Budget
- Monthly budget: 0.1% (43.8 minutes)
- Alert at 50% consumed
- Freeze features at 80% consumed

## Incident Response

### Runbooks
Link to runbooks for common issues:
- [Service restart procedure]
- [Database connection issues]
- [High latency investigation]
- [Rollback procedure]

### On-Call Rotation
- Primary: [Schedule]
- Secondary: [Schedule]
- Escalation: [Manager/Director]

## Compliance and Audit

### Audit Logging
Track and retain:
- Authentication events
- Authorization decisions
- Data modifications
- Configuration changes
- Admin actions

### Compliance Requirements
- [ ] GDPR data privacy
- [ ] SOC 2 controls
- [ ] PCI compliance (if applicable)
- [ ] HIPAA (if applicable)

## Cost Monitoring

### Resource Costs
- Track cloud resource usage
- Alert on cost anomalies
- Monthly budget tracking
- Cost per transaction/user

### Optimization Opportunities
- Identify underutilized resources
- Right-sizing recommendations
- Reserved instance planning
- Data transfer optimization
