# CI/CD Quality Gates Setup Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive CI/CD quality gates that have been implemented for the GRCTool open source project. All changes follow best practices for open source Go projects and provide robust quality checks without blocking development.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Coverage Checking in CI ✅

**File:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**Changes:**
- Enabled the previously disabled coverage job
- Set realistic threshold at 30% (current coverage is sufficient to meet this)
- Will increase threshold as test coverage improves
- Added coverage artifact upload
- Integrated with Codecov (optional, non-blocking)

**Quality Gate:**
- ✅ BLOCKING: Coverage must meet 30% threshold
- ℹ️  INFORMATIONAL: Codecov upload (requires `CODECOV_TOKEN` secret)

### 2. License Header Validation ✅

**File:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**New Job:** `license-check`

**Features:**
- Validates all Go files have Apache 2.0 license headers
- Uses existing script: `/pool0/erik/Projects/grctool/scripts/check-license-headers.sh`
- Script is executable and ready to use
- Checks for SPDX identifier: `SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0`

**Quality Gate:**
- ✅ BLOCKING: All Go files must have license headers

### 3. Security Scanning ✅

**File:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**New Job:** `security-scan`

**Features:**
- gosec static security analysis
- Outputs both JSON and SARIF formats
- SARIF integration with GitHub Code Scanning
- Secret detection using `/pool0/erik/Projects/grctool/scripts/detect-secrets.sh`
- Comprehensive pattern matching for API keys, credentials, etc.

**Quality Gate:**
- ✅ BLOCKING: Secret detection must pass
- ℹ️  INFORMATIONAL: gosec findings (non-blocking, for review)

### 4. Secret Detection in Pre-commit ✅

**File:** `lefthook.yml`

**Status:** Already configured correctly

**Features:**
- Pre-commit hook runs `scripts/detect-secrets.sh` on staged files
- Scans for 30+ types of secrets (API keys, AWS, GitHub, etc.)
- Allows false-positive patterns (test/example credentials)
- Provides clear error messages with remediation steps

### 5. Pull Request Template ✅

**File:** `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`

**Sections:**
- Description and type of change
- Related issues linking
- Testing checklist (unit, integration, functional)
- Documentation requirements
- Code quality checklist
- Security considerations
- Breaking changes documentation
- Performance impact assessment

### 6. Issue Templates ✅

**Directory:** `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`

**Templates Created:**

1. **bug_report.yml** - Structured bug reporting
   - Detailed reproduction steps
   - Environment information (OS, Go version, installation method)
   - Log collection guidance
   - Pre-submission checklist

2. **feature_request.yml** - Feature proposals
   - Problem statement
   - Proposed solution and alternatives
   - Use cases and benefits
   - Contribution willingness

3. **security_vulnerability.yml** - Security issues
   - WARNING: Directs critical issues to private disclosure
   - Only for low-severity or informational security topics
   - References SECURITY.md
   - Prevents accidental public disclosure of vulnerabilities

4. **config.yml** - Issue template configuration
   - Disables blank issues
   - Links to GitHub Discussions
   - Links to documentation
   - Links to security policy

### 7. Coverage Badge in README ✅

**File:** `README.md`

**Added Badges:**
- Codecov coverage badge
- CI status badge

**Location:** Top of README alongside existing badges (License, Go Version, Go Report Card, GitHub Release)

### 8. Documentation Updates ✅

**File:** `CONTRIBUTING.md`

**New Section:** "CI/CD Pipeline"

**Documentation:**
- Overview of all three workflows (CI, Testing, Release)
- Required GitHub secrets (CODECOV_TOKEN - optional)
- Coverage thresholds and targets
- Quality gate requirements
- Troubleshooting guide for common CI failures
- Local CI testing instructions

## Secret Requirements

### Required Secrets: NONE for basic CI

All core CI functionality works without any secrets configured.

### Optional Secrets

| Secret | Purpose | Impact if Missing |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| `CODECOV_TOKEN` | Coverage upload to codecov.io | Coverage still checked locally, just no external dashboard |

### Automatic Secrets

| Secret | Purpose | Provided By |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | SARIF upload, API access | GitHub Actions (automatic) |

3. `lefthook.yml` - ✅ Pre-commit hooks configured with secret detection

## Testing the CI Pipeline

### Local Testing

```bash
# Test all CI checks locally
make ci

# Test specific checks
LEFTHOOK_CONFIG=lefthook-ci.yml lefthook run ci

# Test coverage threshold
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
coverage=$(go tool cover -func=coverage.out | grep total | awk '{print $3}' | sed 's/%//')
echo "Coverage: $coverage%"

# Test license headers
./scripts/check-license-headers.sh

# Test secret detection
./scripts/detect-secrets.sh $(git ls-files)

# Test security scan
gosec ./...
```

### Triggering CI

The CI pipeline runs automatically on:
- Push to main branch
- Pull requests to main branch

Manual trigger: Not available for ci.yml (only testing.yml supports workflow_dispatch)

## Coverage Improvement Plan

Current coverage: ~30-40% across packages
Target: 80% overall

**Improvement Strategy:**
1. Start with 30% threshold (achievable now)
2. Add tests for critical business logic
3. Increase threshold to 50% after test improvements
4. Target 60% for next release
5. Final target: 80% for production readiness

**Per-Package Targets:**
- Core packages (formatters, markdown): Already >50%
- Business logic (services, orchestrator): Need improvement (currently 0%)
- Infrastructure (auth, storage): Moderate coverage (20-40%)

## Troubleshooting

### Common CI Failures

1. **Coverage below threshold (30%)**
   ```bash
   # Check current coverage
   make test-coverage

   # Add tests for packages with 0% coverage
   # Priority: internal/services/*, internal/orchestrator
   ```

2. **License header check fails**
   ```bash
   # Find files missing headers
   ./scripts/check-license-headers.sh

   # Add header to each file (see CONTRIBUTING.md for template)
   ```

3. **Secret detection fails**
   ```bash
   # Review flagged files
   ./scripts/detect-secrets.sh $(git ls-files)

   # Common false positives already excluded:
   # - test/example/sample credentials
   # - Documentation examples
   # - Template variables ($\{.*\}, {{.*}})
   ```

4. **Security scan findings**
   ```bash
   # Run locally
   gosec ./...

   # Review findings (informational only, won't block CI)
   # Address high-severity issues
   ```

## Next Steps

### Recommended Enhancements

1. **Increase test coverage** to enable higher threshold (60%+)
2. **Configure Codecov** for detailed coverage tracking and PR comments
3. **Add CodeQL** for advanced security analysis
4. **Enable Dependabot** for automated dependency updates
5. **Add performance benchmarking** with regression detection

### Long-term Improvements

1. **Multi-platform builds** (macOS, Windows, ARM)
2. **Integration test with live APIs** (separate workflow with secrets)
3. **Automated changelog** generation from conventional commits
4. **Release automation** with goreleaser
5. **Container scanning** if/when Docker images are added
