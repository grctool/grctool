# Phase 5: Deploy - Deployment & Operations

## Overview

The Deploy phase establishes operational procedures for deploying, monitoring, and maintaining GRCTool in production environments. This phase ensures secure, reliable deployments that meet compliance and operational requirements.

## Purpose

- Define deployment procedures and operational runbooks
- Establish monitoring and alerting for system health and security
- Create incident response and troubleshooting procedures
- Ensure production deployments meet security and compliance standards
- Establish operational excellence for GRC compliance workflows

## Current Status

**Phase Completeness: 30%** ⚠️

### ✅ Completed Artifacts
- **Deployment Operations**: High-level deployment strategy and operational procedures

### ⚠️ Missing Critical Artifacts
- **Deployment Checklist**: Detailed deployment validation and rollback procedures
- **Operational Runbook**: Day-to-day operational procedures and troubleshooting
- **Monitoring Setup**: System and security monitoring configuration
- **Security Monitoring**: Compliance-specific monitoring and alerting
