# Operational Runbook - NEEDS CLARIFICATION

<!-- NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Day-to-day operational procedures and troubleshooting -->
<!-- CONTEXT: Phase 5 exit criteria requires operational runbooks created and validated -->
<!-- PRIORITY: High - Required for production operations and incident response -->
