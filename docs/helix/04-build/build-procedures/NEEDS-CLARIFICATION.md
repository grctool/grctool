# Build Procedures - NEEDS CLARIFICATION

<!-- NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Automated build, test, and quality gate procedures -->
<!-- CONTEXT: Phase 4 exit criteria requires build automation pipeline implemented and tested -->
<!-- PRIORITY: High - Required for consistent, reproducible builds and quality assurance -->

## Missing Information Required

### Build Automation Pipeline
- [ ] **CI/CD Configuration**: GitHub Actions or alternative CI/CD pipeline setup
- [ ] **Build Scripts**: Standardized build scripts and Makefile procedures
- [ ] **Quality Gates**: Automated quality checks and pass/fail criteria
- [ ] **Artifact Management**: Build artifact storage, versioning, and distribution

### Build Environment Setup
- [ ] **Development Environment**: Local development build environment standardization
- [ ] **CI Environment**: Continuous integration build environment configuration
- [ ] **Release Environment**: Production release build and packaging procedures
- [ ] **Cross-Platform Builds**: Multi-platform binary compilation and testing

### Quality Assurance Integration
- [ ] **Test Integration**: Automated test execution in build pipeline
- [ ] **Code Quality Gates**: Linting, formatting, and static analysis integration
- [ ] **Security Scanning**: Security vulnerability scanning in build process
- [ ] **Dependency Management**: Dependency scanning and update procedures

## Questions for DevOps Team

1. **What is our build infrastructure?**
   - CI/CD platform selection (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins)
   - Build environment requirements and configuration
   - Artifact storage and distribution mechanisms
   - Cross-platform build requirements and testing

2. **What are our quality gate requirements?**
   - Code quality standards and enforcement mechanisms
   - Test execution requirements and coverage targets
   - Security scanning tools and failure criteria
   - Performance benchmarking and validation procedures

3. **How do we handle releases?**
   - Release versioning and tagging procedures
   - Release candidate validation and testing
   - Release packaging and distribution methods
   - Release communication and documentation procedures

4. **What are our security requirements for builds?**
   - Build environment security and isolation
   - Dependency scanning and vulnerability management
   - Code signing and artifact verification
   - Supply chain security and provenance tracking

## Build Script Specifications

### Makefile Targets
```makefile
# Build targets
.PHONY: build build-all clean
build:
	go build -o bin/grctool ./cmd/grctool

build-all:
	GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o bin/grctool-linux-amd64 ./cmd/grctool
	GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go build -o bin/grctool-darwin-amd64 ./cmd/grctool
	GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o bin/grctool-windows-amd64.exe ./cmd/grctool

# Quality gates
.PHONY: lint test test-coverage security-scan
lint:
	golangci-lint run

test:
	go test -v ./...

test-coverage:
	go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
	go tool cover -html=coverage.out -o coverage.html

security-scan:
	gosec ./...
	govulncheck ./...

# Release targets
.PHONY: release release-prepare
release-prepare:
	@echo "Preparing release $(VERSION)"
	git tag -a v$(VERSION) -m "Release $(VERSION)"

release:
	goreleaser release --rm-dist
```

### Quality Gate Procedures
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Quality gate validation script

set -e

echo "Running quality gates..."

# Code formatting check
echo "Checking code formatting..."
if ! gofmt -l . | grep -q '^$'; then
    echo "ERROR: Code is not properly formatted"
    gofmt -l .
    exit 1
fi

# Linting
echo "Running linter..."
golangci-lint run

# Unit tests with coverage
echo "Running unit tests..."
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...

# Check coverage threshold
COVERAGE=$(go tool cover -func=coverage.out | grep total | awk '{print $3}' | sed 's/%//')
THRESHOLD=80

if (( $(echo "$COVERAGE < $THRESHOLD" | bc -l) )); then
    echo "ERROR: Coverage $COVERAGE% is below threshold $THRESHOLD%"
    exit 1
fi

# Security scanning
echo "Running security scan..."
gosec ./...

# Dependency vulnerability check
echo "Checking dependencies for vulnerabilities..."
govulncheck ./...

echo "All quality gates passed!"
```

## Build Environment Requirements

### Development Environment
- **Go Version**: Go 1.21 or later
- **Build Tools**: Make, Git, Docker (for integration testing)
- **Quality Tools**: golangci-lint, gosec, govulncheck
- **Testing Tools**: testify, testcontainers, bats

### CI/CD Environment
- **Container Base**: Ubuntu latest with Go toolchain
- **Security Tools**: Static analysis and vulnerability scanning
- **Artifact Storage**: GitHub Packages or artifact registry
- **Cross-Platform**: Multi-OS and multi-architecture build support

### Release Environment
- **Code Signing**: GPG or certificate-based code signing
- **Package Management**: Homebrew, APT, RPM package creation
- **Distribution**: GitHub Releases and package repositories
- **Documentation**: Automated documentation generation and publishing

## Security Considerations

### Build Security
- **Dependency Pinning**: Fixed dependency versions and checksum validation
- **Supply Chain Security**: SLSA framework compliance and provenance tracking
- **Secrets Management**: Secure handling of API keys and signing certificates
- **Build Isolation**: Isolated build environments and clean build procedures

### Artifact Security
- **Code Signing**: Digital signatures for all release artifacts
- **Integrity Verification**: Checksums and signature verification procedures
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated scanning of built artifacts
- **Distribution Security**: Secure artifact distribution and verification

## Next Steps

1. **Set up CI/CD pipeline** with GitHub Actions and quality gates
2. **Create comprehensive Makefile** with all build, test, and quality targets
3. **Implement automated security scanning** and vulnerability management
4. **Establish release procedures** with versioning and artifact management
5. **Document build environment setup** and developer onboarding procedures
