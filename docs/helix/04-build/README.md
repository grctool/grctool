# Phase 4: Build - Implementation & Development

## Overview

The Build phase implements the designs and requirements established in previous phases. This phase focuses on secure coding practices, implementation guidance, and build procedures that ensure quality and compliance throughout development.

## Purpose

- Implement system components according to design specifications
- Establish secure coding practices and development standards
- Create build procedures for consistent, reproducible builds
- Ensure implementation meets security and compliance requirements
- Establish code quality gates and review processes

## Current Status

**Phase Completeness: 40%** ⚠️

### ✅ Completed Artifacts
- **Development Practices**: Comprehensive development standards and coding guidelines

### ⚠️ Missing Critical Artifacts
- **Implementation Plan**: Detailed development roadmap and milestone planning
- **Build Procedures**: Automated build, test, and quality gate procedures
- **Secure Coding Guidelines**: Specific security practices for GRC compliance

## Development Principles

### Core Development Principles
1. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementation
2. **Security by Default**: Secure coding practices integrated from start
3. **Compliance First**: Every feature considers regulatory requirements
4. **Code Quality**: Consistent standards and automated quality checks
5. **Documentation**: Code is self-documenting with clear comments

### GRC-Specific Principles
1. **Audit Trail**: All actions logged with immutable audit records
2. **Data Protection**: Sensitive data encrypted and properly handled
3. **Access Control**: Role-based permissions enforced at code level
4. **Evidence Integrity**: Evidence collection maintains chain of custody
5. **Configuration Security**: Secure defaults and configuration validation

## Implementation Areas

### Core Components
- **CLI Framework**: Cobra-based command structure
- **API Clients**: Tugboat Logic and Claude AI integrations
- **Evidence Collection**: Tool-specific evidence gathering
- **Data Storage**: Local JSON storage with encryption
- **Authentication**: OAuth2 and token management

### Security Components
- **Encryption**: At-rest and in-transit data protection
- **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication support
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive, tamper-evident logs
- **Secret Management**: Secure credential storage and rotation

### Compliance Components
- **Control Mapping**: Controls mapped to code components
- **Evidence Validation**: Automated evidence quality checks
- **Reporting**: Compliance reports and dashboards
- **Data Governance**: Data classification and handling
- **Audit Support**: Audit trail generation and export

## Build Pipeline

### Build Stages
1. **Source Control**: Git-based version control with branch protection
2. **Static Analysis**: Code quality and security scanning
3. **Unit Testing**: Automated unit test execution with coverage
4. **Integration Testing**: Component and API testing
5. **Security Scanning**: Vulnerability and dependency scanning
6. **Artifact Generation**: Binary and container image creation
7. **Quality Gates**: Automated quality and security gates

### Quality Gates
- **Code Coverage**: >80% unit test coverage required
- **Security Scan**: No high or critical security findings
- **Lint Checks**: Code style and quality standards enforced
- **Dependency Check**: No known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **Performance**: Response time and memory usage within limits

## Risk Factors

### High Risk
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Implementation introducing security flaws
- **Compliance Gaps**: Code not meeting regulatory requirements
- **Quality Issues**: Poor code quality affecting maintainability

### Medium Risk
- **Performance Issues**: Implementation not meeting performance requirements
