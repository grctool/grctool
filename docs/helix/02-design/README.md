# Phase 2: Design - Architecture & Design Decisions

## Overview

The Design phase translates requirements from Phase 1 into concrete architectural decisions and solution designs. This phase establishes the technical foundation and design patterns that will guide development.

## Purpose

- Define system architecture and component interactions
- Establish security architecture and controls
- Create API contracts and data models
- Document architectural decisions and rationale
- Design solutions that meet compliance requirements

## Current Status

**Phase Completeness: 70%** ⚠️

### ✅ Completed Artifacts
- **System Architecture**: Comprehensive system design with component diagrams
- **Security Architecture**: Zero-trust security model and controls implementation

### ⚠️ Missing Critical Artifacts
- **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**: Formal decision documentation
- **API Contracts**: Service interfaces and data contracts
- **Data Design**: Database schema and data flow diagrams

## Entry Criteria

- [ ] ✅ Phase 1 requirements stable and approved
- [ ] ✅ Stakeholder alignment on functional requirements
- [ ] ⚠️ Threat model completed and reviewed
- [ ] ✅ Compliance requirements clearly defined
- [ ] Technical constraints identified

## Exit Criteria

- [ ] ✅ System architecture documented and approved
- [ ] ✅ Security architecture reviewed by security team
- [ ] ⚠️ Key architectural decisions documented in ADRs
- [ ] ⚠️ API contracts defined for external integrations
- [ ] ⚠️ Data models designed for compliance requirements
- [ ] Security controls mapped to architecture components
- [ ] Performance and scalability requirements addressed

## Workflow Progression

### Prerequisites for Phase 3 (Test)
1. **Architecture Stability**: Core architecture decisions finalized
2. **Security Review**: Security architecture approved by security team
3. **API Contracts**: External integration points clearly defined
4. **Data Design**: Database schema and data flows documented

### Phase Transition Checklist
- [ ] All exit criteria met
- [ ] Architecture review completed with engineering team
- [ ] Security architecture approved by security team
- [ ] API contracts reviewed with external partners
- [ ] Data design validated with compliance team
- [ ] Phase 3 team briefed on architecture decisions
- [ ] Test planning workshop scheduled

## Key Stakeholders

- **Technical Architect**: Overall system design and technology decisions
- **Security Architect**: Security controls and threat mitigation design
- **API Team**: Service contracts and integration design
- **Data Architect**: Database design and data governance
- **Platform Team**: Infrastructure and deployment architecture

## Dependencies

### Upstream Dependencies (from Phase 1)
- Product requirements and feature scope
- Compliance requirements and controls mapping
- Security requirements and threat model
- User stories and acceptance criteria

### Downstream Dependencies (to Phase 3)
- Test strategy depends on architecture components
- Security testing depends on security architecture
- Integration testing depends on API contracts
- Data testing depends on data models

## Architecture Principles

### Core Principles
1. **Security by Design**: Security controls integrated from the start
2. **Compliance First**: Architecture supports regulatory requirements
3. **API-Driven**: All interactions through well-defined APIs
4. **Cloud Native**: Designed for cloud deployment and scalability
5. **Zero Trust**: No implicit trust between components

### GRC-Specific Principles
1. **Audit Trail**: All actions logged and traceable
2. **Data Sovereignty**: Data location and governance controls
3. **Evidence Chain**: Immutable evidence collection and storage
4. **Access Control**: Role-based access with least privilege
5. **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit

## Risk Factors

### High Risk
- **Compliance Gaps**: Architecture not meeting regulatory requirements
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Design flaws creating security risks
- **Integration Complexity**: External API dependencies creating bottlenecks

### Medium Risk
- **Performance Issues**: Architecture not meeting scale requirements
- **Technology Debt**: Architectural decisions creating future maintenance burden

## Success Metrics

- **Architecture Review Score**: >90% approval from technical review board
- **Security Assessment**: Zero high-risk security findings
- **Compliance Mapping**: 100% of controls mapped to architecture components
- **API Coverage**: All external integrations have documented contracts

## Design Patterns

### Applied Patterns
- **Event Sourcing**: For audit trail and compliance evidence
- **CQRS**: Separation of command and query responsibilities
- **API Gateway**: Centralized API management and security
- **Microservices**: Loosely coupled, independently deployable services
- **Zero Trust Network**: No implicit trust, verify everything

### Compliance Patterns
- **Evidence Collection**: Automated evidence gathering and storage
- **Control Mapping**: Direct mapping of controls to code components
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive, immutable audit trails
- **Data Classification**: Automated data sensitivity classification

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Create ADR template and document key decisions
   - Define API contracts for Tugboat and Claude integrations
   - Design database schema for evidence storage

2. **Phase 3 Preparation**:
   - Schedule test strategy workshop
   - Prepare architecture handoff package
   - Set up test phase artifacts structure
