# Architecture Decision Records (ADR) - NEEDS CLARIFICATION

<!-- NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Document key architectural decisions and rationale -->
<!-- CONTEXT: Phase 2 exit criteria requires key architectural decisions documented in ADRs -->
<!-- PRIORITY: High - Essential for development team understanding and future maintenance -->

## Missing Information Required

### ADR Framework Setup
- [ ] **ADR Template**: Establish standard ADR template and numbering scheme
- [ ] **Decision Categories**: Define categories of decisions requiring ADRs
- [ ] **Review Process**: Establish ADR review and approval process
- [ ] **Storage Location**: Organize ADR storage and cross-referencing

### Key Decisions Requiring Documentation
- [ ] **Technology Stack**: Go language choice, CLI framework selection (Cobra)
- [ ] **API Integration**: Tugboat Logic API design patterns, Claude AI integration approach
- [ ] **Data Storage**: Local JSON storage vs. database, encryption approach
- [ ] **Authentication**: OAuth2 implementation, token management, session handling
- [ ] **Security Architecture**: Zero-trust model implementation, encryption strategies

### Architectural Decision Categories
- [ ] **Technology Decisions**: Programming languages, frameworks, libraries
- [ ] **Integration Decisions**: External API patterns, data exchange formats
- [ ] **Security Decisions**: Authentication mechanisms, encryption choices
- [ ] **Deployment Decisions**: Packaging strategies, distribution methods
- [ ] **Data Decisions**: Storage formats, caching strategies, backup approaches

## Template Structure Needed

## Questions for Technical Architecture Team

1. **What major architectural decisions have been made?**
   - Technology stack selection rationale
   - Integration pattern choices
   - Security design decisions
   - Data storage and management approaches

2. **What decisions need documentation?**
   - Which decisions are significant enough for ADRs?
   - What decisions might be questioned in the future?
   - Which decisions affect multiple teams or components?

3. **What is the ADR process?**
   - Who should review and approve ADRs?
   - When should ADRs be created in the development process?
   - How should ADRs be maintained and updated?

4. **What are the trade-offs for key decisions?**
   - What alternatives were considered?
   - What were the deciding factors?
   - What are the ongoing implications?

## Critical ADRs Needed

### ADR-001: Go + Cobra Technology Stack
- **Decision**: Use Go with Cobra CLI framework
- **Context**: Need for cross-platform CLI with strong typing and performance
- **Alternatives**: Python with Click, Rust with Clap, Node.js with Commander

### ADR-002: API Integration Patterns
- **Decision**: REST API clients with structured error handling
- **Context**: Integration with Tugboat Logic and Claude AI APIs
- **Alternatives**: GraphQL clients, gRPC, SDK-based integration

### ADR-003: Local JSON Storage
- **Decision**: Encrypted local JSON files for evidence and configuration
- **Context**: Need for offline capability and simple data management
- **Alternatives**: SQLite database, cloud storage, remote database

### ADR-004: OAuth2 Authentication
- **Decision**: OAuth2 with PKCE for secure authentication
- **Context**: Need for secure, user-friendly authentication
- **Alternatives**: API keys, basic auth, custom authentication

### ADR-005: Zero-Trust Security Model
- **Decision**: Implement zero-trust architecture with encryption everywhere
- **Context**: GRC compliance requirements and security best practices
- **Alternatives**: Perimeter-based security, network segmentation

## Impact on Development

**Development Guidance**: ADRs provide clear rationale for implementation decisions
**Onboarding**: New team members can understand architectural choices
**Maintenance**: Future changes can reference original decision context
**Compliance**: Audit trail of security and architectural decisions

## Next Steps

1. **Establish ADR template** and process for creation and review
2. **Document existing decisions** made during architecture phase
3. **Create ADR registry** with cross-references and search capability
4. **Train team** on ADR creation and maintenance process
5. **Integrate ADRs** into code review and architectural review processes
