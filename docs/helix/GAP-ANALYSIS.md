# HELIX Workflow Gap Analysis Report

**Generated**: 2025-09-22
**Analyst**: Claude Code Agent
**Project**: GRCTool - Automated compliance evidence collection CLI
**HELIX Version**: Based on DDX Library Workflows v1.0

## Executive Summary

This gap analysis evaluates the current HELIX documentation structure for GRCTool against the established HELIX workflow standards. While the existing structure demonstrates a solid foundation with comprehensive content across all six phases, several critical gaps exist that prevent optimal HELIX workflow execution.

**Overall Assessment**: 🟡 **PARTIAL COMPLIANCE** - 65% aligned with HELIX standards

### Key Findings

- ✅ **Strengths**: All 6 phases present with substantive content
- ✅ **Strengths**: High-quality, GRC-focused documentation
- ⚠️ **Major Gap**: Missing phase README.md files for workflow orchestration
- ⚠️ **Major Gap**: Flat file structure lacking HELIX artifact hierarchy
- ⚠️ **Major Gap**: No workflow enforcement or gate validation mechanisms
