# Phase 3: Test - Testing Strategy & Quality Assurance

## Overview

The Test phase establishes comprehensive testing strategies to ensure GRCTool meets quality, security, and compliance requirements. This phase defines how we validate that our implementation correctly fulfills the requirements and design specifications.

## Purpose

- Define multi-tier testing strategy for quality assurance
- Establish security testing procedures and compliance validation
- Create test procedures for automated and manual testing
- Ensure evidence collection accuracy and audit trail integrity
- Validate regulatory compliance through systematic testing

## Current Status

**Phase Completeness: 50%** ⚠️

### ✅ Completed Artifacts
- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive 4-tier testing approach with quality metrics

### ⚠️ Missing Critical Artifacts
- **Test Procedures**: Detailed test procedures for each testing tier
- **Security Tests**: Specific security testing plans and penetration testing procedures

## Testing Tiers

### Tier 1: Unit Testing (Developers)
- **Scope**: Individual functions and methods
- **Tools**: Go testing framework, testify, gomock
- **Coverage**: >80% code coverage target
- **Speed**: <30 seconds total execution time
- **Frequency**: Every commit

### Tier 2: Integration Testing (CI/CD)
- **Scope**: Component interactions and API endpoints
- **Tools**: Docker Compose, testcontainers
- **Coverage**: All API endpoints and external integrations
- **Speed**: <5 minutes total execution time
- **Frequency**: Every pull request

### Tier 3: Functional Testing (QA)
- **Scope**: End-to-end user workflows and CLI commands
- **Tools**: Bats (Bash testing), golden file testing
- **Coverage**: All user-facing features
- **Speed**: <15 minutes total execution time
- **Frequency**: Release candidates

### Tier 4: Compliance Testing (Manual + Automated)
- **Scope**: Regulatory compliance and audit requirements
- **Tools**: Custom compliance validators, audit tools
- **Coverage**: All compliance controls and evidence types
- **Speed**: Variable (up to 2 hours for full suite)
- **Frequency**: Pre-release and quarterly audits

## Workflow Progression

### Prerequisites for Phase 4 (Build)
1. **Test Strategy Approval**: All stakeholders approve testing approach
2. **Test Environment**: Test infrastructure provisioned and validated
3. **Test Data**: Secure test data management procedures established
4. **Automation Framework**: Core test automation infrastructure ready

### Phase Transition Checklist
- [ ] All exit criteria met
- [ ] Test strategy review completed with QA team
- [ ] Security test plans approved by security team
- [ ] Test automation framework validated
- [ ] Test data procedures reviewed with compliance team
- [ ] Phase 4 team briefed on testing requirements
- [ ] Development kickoff meeting scheduled

## Key Stakeholders

- **QA Lead**: Overall testing strategy and quality assurance
- **Security Tester**: Security testing and penetration testing
- **DevOps Engineer**: Test automation and CI/CD integration
- **Compliance Officer**: Regulatory testing and audit procedures
- **Development Team**: Unit testing and testability design

## Dependencies

### Upstream Dependencies (from Phase 2)
- System architecture and component boundaries
- API contracts and interface specifications
- Security architecture and control implementations
- Data models and database schema

### Downstream Dependencies (to Phase 4)
- Development practices depend on testing requirements
- Build procedures depend on test automation
- Code quality gates depend on test coverage metrics
- Release criteria depend on compliance testing results

## Test Categories

### Functional Testing
- **User Story Validation**: Each user story has corresponding tests
- **CLI Command Testing**: All CLI commands tested with various inputs
- **Evidence Collection Testing**: Accuracy of evidence gathering
- **Workflow Testing**: End-to-end compliance workflows

### Non-Functional Testing
- **Performance Testing**: Response times and throughput under load
- **Security Testing**: Vulnerability scanning and penetration testing
- **Compliance Testing**: Regulatory requirement validation
- **Usability Testing**: User experience and documentation clarity

### Security Testing Categories
- **Authentication Testing**: Login, tokens, session management
- **Authorization Testing**: Role-based access control validation
- **Data Protection Testing**: Encryption, data masking, secure storage
- **Audit Trail Testing**: Log integrity and evidence chain validation
- **Vulnerability Testing**: Static analysis, dependency scanning, penetration testing

## Risk Factors

### High Risk
- **Test Data Security**: Exposure of sensitive data in test environments
- **Compliance Gaps**: Missing test coverage for regulatory requirements
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Inadequate security testing allowing vulnerabilities

### Medium Risk
- **Test Environment Stability**: Unreliable test environments affecting quality
- **Test Automation Complexity**: Over-complex automation reducing maintainability

## Success Metrics

- **Test Coverage**: >80% unit test coverage, 100% critical path coverage
- **Defect Escape Rate**: <5% of defects escape to production
- **Test Execution Time**: All tiers complete within target timeframes
- **Security Test Results**: Zero high-severity security findings
- **Compliance Validation**: 100% of compliance controls validated

## Quality Gates

### Code Quality Gates
