# Product Requirements and Vision

## Product Summary

**GRCTool** is a command-line application that automates security program compliance through intelligent integration with Tugboat Logic. It bridges the gap between manual compliance processes and modern infrastructure automation, making compliance evidence generation efficient, accurate, and auditable.

## Core Problem Statement

Manual compliance evidence collection is:
- **Slow and time-consuming**: Hours spent gathering data from multiple sources
- **Error-prone**: Human mistakes in data collection and formatting
- **Scattered**: Information spread across tools, documentation, and systems
- **Difficult to maintain**: Keeping alignment between policies, controls, and evidence

## Solution Architecture

GRCTool provides:
- **Automated data synchronization** from Tugboat Logic
- **AI-powered evidence generation** using Claude AI
- **Infrastructure-aware analysis** with Terraform and GitHub integration
- **Relationship mapping** between policies, controls, and evidence tasks
- **Auditable, traceable outputs** with reasoning and source attribution

## Target Audience

### Primary Users

#### Compliance Managers
- **Need**: Quarterly SOC 2 evidence with minimal manual effort
- **Benefits**: Guided, repeatable evidence generation process
- **Use Cases**: Audit preparation, compliance reporting, evidence review

#### Security Engineers
- **Need**: Prove control implementations with technical evidence
- **Benefits**: Automated extraction from Terraform and GitHub workflows
- **Use Cases**: Security control validation, infrastructure compliance

#### DevOps/Site Reliability Engineers
- **Need**: Validate infrastructure settings tied to compliance controls
- **Benefits**: Direct integration with existing infrastructure-as-code
- **Use Cases**: IAM validation, network security verification, encryption compliance

### Secondary Users

#### Auditors (External)
- **Benefits**: Structured, traceable outputs with clear reasoning
- **Value**: Faster audit processes with comprehensive documentation

#### Engineering Managers
- **Benefits**: Oversight of compliance status and evidence quality
- **Value**: Risk visibility and team efficiency metrics

## Key Features

### Core Capabilities
- **🔐 Automated Browser Authentication** - Safari-based login with automatic cookie extraction (macOS)
- **📊 Data Synchronization** - Download policies, controls, and evidence tasks via REST API
- **🤖 AI-Powered Evidence Generation** - Uses Claude AI to intelligently generate compliance evidence
- **🔍 Evidence Analysis** - Maps relationships between evidence tasks, controls, and policies
- **🛡️ Security Control Mapping** - Automated mapping of infrastructure to compliance controls
- **📄 Multiple Output Formats** - Generate evidence in CSV or Markdown formats
- **💾 Local Data Storage** - JSON-based storage for offline access and analysis

### Technology Integration
- **Terraform Analysis** for infrastructure compliance
- **GitHub Workflow Validation** for process compliance
- **SOC 2 Control Mapping** with built-in frameworks
- **Infrastructure-as-Code Awareness** for modern cloud environments

## Success Metrics

### Operational Excellence
- **Sync reliability**: >99% success rate with automatic retries
- **Evidence generation**: ≥80% success rate without manual intervention
- **Test coverage**: ≥80% for core packages with comprehensive CI/CD

### User Value
- **Time savings**: ≥60% reduction in manual evidence preparation time
- **Quality improvement**: ≥90% of generated evidence accepted after single review
- **Audit efficiency**: Time-to-audit-readiness reduced from days to hours

### Technical Performance
- **Response time**: CLI commands complete within seconds
- **Resource efficiency**: Minimal memory and CPU usage
- **Reliability**: Deterministic behavior across environments

## Competitive Landscape

### Current Alternatives

#### Manual Processes
- **Tugboat Logic UI**: Manual evidence upload and management
- **Spreadsheet-based**: Custom Excel/Google Sheets workflows
- **Document-centric**: Word documents and file sharing

#### Commercial Solutions
- **Enterprise GRC platforms**: Heavy, expensive, slow to customize
- **Compliance automation tools**: Limited infrastructure integration
- **Custom scripts**: Organization-specific, unmaintainable solutions

### GRCTool Differentiators

#### Open and Extensible
- **Open source architecture** allows customization and contribution
- **CLI-native approach** integrates with existing developer workflows
- **Extensible tool system** for organization-specific evidence collection

#### Infrastructure-Aware
- **Native Terraform integration** understands modern infrastructure
- **GitHub workflow analysis** for DevOps process compliance
- **Cloud-native understanding** of modern security architectures

#### AI-Assisted
- **Context-aware evidence generation** using domain knowledge
- **Reasoning transparency** for audit and review processes
- **Continuous improvement** through feedback and iteration

#### Developer-Focused
- **Command-line interface** for automation and scripting
- **Configuration-as-code** for version control and reproducibility
- **Comprehensive testing** for reliability and confidence

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Technical Risks

#### API Dependency Risk
- **Risk**: Tugboat Logic API changes could break functionality
- **Mitigation**: VCR-backed testing, adaptable client parsing, version compatibility

#### Platform Dependency Risk
- **Risk**: macOS-only authentication limits adoption
- **Mitigation**: Document manual authentication alternatives, plan cross-platform auth

#### AI Quality Risk
- **Risk**: Claude AI responses may vary in quality or relevance
- **Mitigation**: Include reasoning in outputs, multi-source aggregation, review workflows

### Business Risks

#### Credential Security Risk
- **Risk**: Authentication credentials could be compromised
- **Mitigation**: Browser-based auth, secret redaction, no credential storage in code

#### Compliance Risk
- **Risk**: Generated evidence might not meet audit requirements
- **Mitigation**: Transparency in reasoning, source attribution, manual review processes

#### Adoption Risk
- **Risk**: Teams might not adopt CLI-based workflow
- **Mitigation**: Clear documentation, training materials, gradual rollout

## Future Vision

### Short-term Goals (v1.0)
- **Evidence submission API** integration with Tugboat Logic
- **Comprehensive VCR test coverage** for all API interactions
- **Structured logging** throughout the application
- **Complete documentation** and user guides

### Medium-term Goals (v1.1-1.5)
- **Additional evidence tools** (Google Docs, AWS Config, etc.)
- **Batch operations** with progress tracking and parallelism
- **Performance optimization** for large datasets
- **Enhanced reporting** and analytics

### Long-term Vision (v2.0+)
- **Real-time compliance monitoring** with continuous evidence collection
- **Multi-framework support** (ISO 27001, PCI DSS, HITRUST)
- **Plugin architecture** for custom evidence collectors
- **Web interface** for non-technical users
- **Integration marketplace** for common tools and platforms
