# Phase 1: Frame - Problem Definition & Requirements

## Overview

The Frame phase establishes the foundation for GRCTool development by defining the problem space, requirements, and constraints. This phase ensures all stakeholders have a shared understanding of what we're building and why.

## Purpose

- Define product requirements and scope
- Capture user stories and use cases
- Establish compliance and security requirements
- Map stakeholder needs and expectations
- Identify threats and risk factors

## Current Status

**Phase Completeness: 60%** ⚠️

### ✅ Completed Artifacts
- **Product Requirements**: Comprehensive PRD with core features defined
- **User Stories**: Detailed user stories with acceptance criteria
- **Compliance Requirements**: SOC2, ISO27001, and regulatory requirements

### ⚠️ Missing Critical Artifacts
- **Stakeholder Map**: Stakeholder analysis and communication plan
- **Threat Model**: Security threat modeling and risk assessment

## Entry Criteria

- [ ] Project charter approved
- [ ] Initial stakeholder identification complete
- [ ] High-level business objectives defined
- [ ] Security and compliance scope established

## Exit Criteria

- [ ] ✅ Product requirements documented and approved
- [ ] ✅ User stories defined with acceptance criteria
- [ ] ✅ Compliance requirements mapped to controls
- [ ] ⚠️ Stakeholder map created and validated
- [ ] ⚠️ Threat model completed and reviewed
- [ ] ⚠️ Security requirements extracted and documented
- [ ] All stakeholders agree on scope and approach

## Workflow Progression

### Prerequisites for Phase 2 (Design)
1. **Requirements Stability**: Core requirements must be stable (no major changes expected)
2. **Stakeholder Alignment**: All key stakeholders must approve the requirements
3. **Compliance Clarity**: Regulatory requirements must be clearly understood
4. **Threat Understanding**: Security threats must be identified and assessed

### Phase Transition Checklist
- [ ] All exit criteria met
- [ ] Requirements review completed with stakeholders
- [ ] Compliance team sign-off obtained
- [ ] Security team threat model review complete
- [ ] Phase 2 team briefed on requirements
- [ ] Handoff meeting scheduled with design team

## Key Stakeholders

- **Product Owner**: Requirements definition and prioritization
- **Compliance Team**: Regulatory requirements and controls mapping
- **Security Team**: Threat modeling and security requirements
- **Engineering Team**: Technical feasibility and constraints
- **Legal Team**: Regulatory interpretation and risk assessment

## Dependencies

### Upstream Dependencies
- Business strategy and objectives
- Regulatory compliance mandates
- Security policies and standards
- Market research and competitive analysis

### Downstream Dependencies
- Phase 2 (Design) depends on stable requirements
- Architecture decisions depend on threat model
- Development planning depends on user stories
- Testing strategy depends on acceptance criteria

## Risk Factors

### High Risk
- **Regulatory Changes**: New compliance requirements emerging during development
- **Stakeholder Misalignment**: Conflicting requirements from different stakeholders
- **Scope Creep**: Requirements expanding beyond initial definition

### Medium Risk
- **Technical Constraints**: Unforeseen technical limitations affecting requirements
- **Resource Availability**: Key stakeholders unavailable for requirements review

## Success Metrics

- **Requirements Stability**: <10% change rate after exit criteria met
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction**: >90% approval rating on requirements clarity
- **Compliance Coverage**: 100% of required controls mapped to requirements
- **Threat Coverage**: All identified threats have corresponding security requirements

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Create stakeholder map and communication plan
   - Conduct threat modeling workshop
   - Extract security requirements from compliance documents

2. **Phase 2 Preparation**:
   - Schedule architecture workshop
   - Prepare requirements handoff package
   - Set up design phase artifacts structure
