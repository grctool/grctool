# Stakeholder Map - NEEDS CLARIFICATION

<!-- NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Complete stakeholder analysis and communication planning -->
<!-- CONTEXT: Phase 1 exit criteria requires stakeholder map to be created and validated -->
<!-- PRIORITY: High - Blocks transition to Phase 2 (Design) -->

## Missing Information Required

### Stakeholder Identification
- [ ] **Internal Stakeholders**: Product owners, engineering teams, compliance officers, security teams
- [ ] **External Stakeholders**: Auditors, regulatory bodies, customers, partners
- [ ] **Executive Stakeholders**: Management sponsors, budget owners, decision makers

### Stakeholder Analysis Requirements
- [ ] **Influence vs Interest Matrix**: Map stakeholder influence and interest levels
- [ ] **Communication Preferences**: How each stakeholder prefers to receive updates
- [ ] **Decision Authority**: Who has authority to approve requirements and changes
- [ ] **Success Criteria**: What constitutes success for each stakeholder group

### Communication Planning
- [ ] **Regular Touchpoints**: Weekly/monthly review schedules with key stakeholders
- [ ] **Escalation Paths**: How to escalate issues and get unblocking decisions
- [ ] **Approval Workflows**: Requirements approval process and sign-off procedures
- [ ] **Change Management**: How to communicate and manage requirement changes

## Template Structure Needed

## Questions for Product Management

1. **Who are the primary internal stakeholders?**
   - Which teams need to approve requirements?
   - Who are the key decision makers for scope changes?
   - What are the reporting and communication expectations?

2. **Who are the external stakeholders?**
   - Which auditors or regulatory bodies will review our compliance?
   - Are there customer representatives who should be involved?
   - Do we have partner integrations that require stakeholder involvement?

3. **What are the communication requirements?**
   - How often should stakeholders receive project updates?
   - What format do stakeholders prefer (meetings, reports, dashboards)?
   - Are there specific compliance or audit communication requirements?

4. **What approval processes are required?**
   - Who needs to sign off on requirements before Phase 2?
   - What is the change approval process for requirements updates?
   - Are there legal or compliance approvals needed?

## Impact on HELIX Workflow

**Current Risk**: Phase 1 cannot complete without stakeholder alignment
**Dependencies**: All subsequent phases depend on stable stakeholder agreement
**Timeline**: This gap adds 2-3 days to Phase 1 completion

## Next Steps

1. **Schedule stakeholder identification workshop** with product management
2. **Create stakeholder registry** with contact information and roles
3. **Develop communication plan** with regular touchpoints and escalation paths
4. **Establish approval workflows** for requirements and change management
