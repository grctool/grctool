# Security Requirements - NEEDS CLARIFICATION

<!-- NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Extract and organize security requirements from compliance documents -->
<!-- CONTEXT: Security requirements need to be separated from compliance requirements for better organization -->
<!-- PRIORITY: High - Required for security architecture design in Phase 2 -->

## Missing Information Required

### Security Requirement Extraction
- [ ] **From Compliance Requirements**: Extract security-specific requirements from SOC2, ISO27001, NIST
- [ ] **Functional Security**: Authentication, authorization, encryption, audit logging
- [ ] **Non-Functional Security**: Performance under attack, resilience, recovery
- [ ] **Operational Security**: Security monitoring, incident response, vulnerability management

### Security Requirement Categories
- [ ] **Access Control Requirements**: Authentication, authorization, and privilege management
- [ ] **Data Protection Requirements**: Encryption, data handling, and privacy protection
- [ ] **Audit and Logging Requirements**: Security event logging and audit trail protection
- [ ] **Infrastructure Security Requirements**: Network security, host security, and configuration management

### GRC-Specific Security Requirements
- [ ] **Evidence Protection**: Security controls for compliance evidence collection and storage
- [ ] **Audit Trail Integrity**: Immutable audit logging and evidence chain of custody
- [ ] **Regulatory Data Protection**: Jurisdiction-specific data protection requirements
- [ ] **Control Monitoring**: Security monitoring of compliance control effectiveness

## Security Requirements Sources

### Compliance Frameworks
1. **SOC2 Type II Requirements**
   - CC6.1: Logical and physical access controls
   - CC6.2: Transmission and disposal of information
   - CC6.3: Access control management
   - CC6.4: Restriction of access rights
   - CC6.6: Vulnerability management
   - CC6.7: Data transmission controls
   - CC6.8: Change management controls

2. **ISO27001:2022 Controls**
   - A.5.3: Information security in project management
   - A.8.2: Privileged access rights
   - A.8.3: Information access restriction
   - A.8.8: Secure log-on procedures
   - A.8.10: Cryptography

3. **NIST CSF 2.0**
   - ID.AM: Asset Management
   - PR.AC: Access Control
   - PR.DS: Data Security
   - DE.AE: Anomalies and Events
   - RS.RP: Response Planning

### Technical Security Requirements
- [ ] **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication, OAuth2, session management
- [ ] **Authorization**: Role-based access control, least privilege, segregation of duties
- [ ] **Encryption**: Data at rest encryption, data in transit protection, key management
- [ ] **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging, log integrity, log retention

## Questions for Security Team

1. **What are our baseline security requirements?**
   - Organizational security standards and policies
   - Industry-specific security requirements
   - Regulatory security mandates

2. **How do we handle GRC-specific security needs?**
   - Evidence protection and chain of custody
   - Audit trail integrity and immutability
   - Compliance control monitoring and alerting

3. **What are the technical security specifications?**
   - Encryption algorithms and key lengths
   - Authentication protocols and token lifetimes
   - Logging formats and retention periods

4. **How do we integrate with existing security infrastructure?**
   - Identity and access management systems
   - Security information and event management (SIEM)
   - Vulnerability management and security scanning

## Security Architecture Dependencies

**Phase 2 Dependencies**: Security architecture design requires these requirements
**Implementation Dependencies**: Development practices must address these requirements
**Operational Dependencies**: Deployment and monitoring must support these requirements

## High-Priority Security Requirements (Initial Assessment)

### Access Control
- **Requirement**: Multi-factor authentication for all user access
- **Rationale**: SOC2 CC6.1 and industry best practices
- **Implementation**: OAuth2 with MFA, session timeouts

### Data Protection
- **Requirement**: Encryption of sensitive data at rest and in transit
- **Rationale**: SOC2 CC6.7, GDPR, and data protection regulations
- **Implementation**: AES-256 encryption, TLS 1.3, key rotation

### Audit Logging
- **Requirement**: Comprehensive, immutable audit trails
- **Rationale**: SOC2 audit requirements, regulatory compliance
- **Implementation**: Structured logging, log integrity protection, retention

### Vulnerability Management
- **Requirement**: Continuous vulnerability scanning and remediation
- **Rationale**: SOC2 CC6.6, security best practices
- **Implementation**: Automated scanning, patch management, security testing

## Next Steps

1. **Extract security requirements** from existing compliance documents
2. **Organize requirements** by category and priority
3. **Define technical specifications** for each security requirement
4. **Map requirements** to compliance controls and standards
5. **Validate requirements** with security and compliance teams
