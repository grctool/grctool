# Threat Model - NEEDS CLARIFICATION

<!-- NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Complete security threat modeling and risk assessment -->
<!-- CONTEXT: Phase 1 exit criteria requires threat model to be completed and reviewed -->
<!-- PRIORITY: High - Critical for security architecture design in Phase 2 -->

## Missing Information Required

### Threat Modeling Methodology
- [ ] **Framework Selection**: Choose threat modeling framework (STRIDE, PASTA, VAST, etc.)
- [ ] **Scope Definition**: Define boundaries of threat model (CLI, APIs, data flow)
- [ ] **Asset Identification**: Catalog all assets requiring protection
- [ ] **Trust Boundaries**: Identify trust boundaries and security perimeters

### Threat Assessment Requirements
- [ ] **Attack Vectors**: Identify potential attack vectors and threat actors
- [ ] **Risk Analysis**: Assess likelihood and impact of identified threats
- [ ] **Threat Prioritization**: Rank threats by risk level and business impact
- [ ] **Mitigation Strategies**: Define security controls for each threat category

### GRC-Specific Threats
- [ ] **Compliance Threats**: Risks to regulatory compliance and audit integrity
- [ ] **Evidence Tampering**: Threats to evidence collection and audit trail integrity
- [ ] **Data Sovereignty**: Risks related to data location and jurisdictional requirements
- [ ] **Access Control**: Threats to role-based access and least privilege principles

## Template Structure Needed

## Questions for Security Team

1. **What threat modeling framework should we use?**
   - Do we have organizational standards for threat modeling?
   - Which framework best fits our GRC compliance requirements?
   - Are there existing threat models for similar systems we can reference?

2. **What are the key assets to protect?**
   - Compliance evidence and audit trails
   - API credentials and authentication tokens
   - Configuration data and system secrets
   - User data and access control information

3. **What are the primary threat actors?**
   - External attackers seeking compliance data
   - Malicious insiders with system access
   - Nation-state actors targeting regulatory data
   - Competitors seeking business intelligence

4. **What compliance-specific threats exist?**
   - Evidence tampering or audit trail manipulation
   - Unauthorized access to compliance controls
   - Data sovereignty and cross-border transfer risks
   - Regulatory reporting accuracy and integrity

## Security Architecture Dependencies

**Impact on Phase 2**: Security architecture design depends on threat model
**Control Design**: Security controls must address identified threats
**Compliance Mapping**: Threats must map to regulatory control requirements

## Threat Categories to Address

### Data Protection Threats
- **Data Exfiltration**: Unauthorized access to compliance evidence
- **Data Corruption**: Tampering with audit trails and evidence
- **Data Loss**: Accidental or malicious deletion of compliance data

### Access Control Threats
- **Privilege Escalation**: Unauthorized elevation of system privileges
- **Account Compromise**: Compromise of user or service accounts
- **Session Hijacking**: Unauthorized access to active user sessions

### System Integrity Threats
- **Code Injection**: Malicious code execution in CLI or API components
- **Supply Chain**: Compromised dependencies or third-party components
- **Configuration Tampering**: Unauthorized modification of system configuration

### Compliance-Specific Threats
- **Audit Trail Manipulation**: Tampering with compliance audit logs
- **Evidence Fabrication**: Creation of false compliance evidence
- **Regulatory Bypass**: Circumvention of compliance controls and procedures

## Next Steps

1. **Schedule threat modeling workshop** with security and development teams
2. **Select threat modeling framework** and establish methodology
3. **Conduct systematic threat identification** using chosen framework
4. **Create risk assessment matrix** with likelihood and impact analysis
5. **Define mitigation strategies** for high-priority threats
