Initiate login with valid username/password\n2. When prompted for MFA, intercept the request\n3. Modify the `mfa_required` parameter from `true` to `false`\n4. Submit the modified request\n5. Authentication succeeds without MFA verification\n\n## Impact\n\n- Complete account takeover for any user account\n- Access to sensitive customer data\n- Potential compliance violations (SOC2, GDPR)\n\n## Affected Versions\n\n- v2.1.0 through v2.3.5\n- Estimated 10,000+ user accounts affected\n\n## Remediation\n\n- Implement server-side MFA validation\n- Add request integrity checks\n- Audit all authentication-related code\n\n## Disclosure Timeline\n\n- **2024-06-25**: Initial report\n- **2024-06-26**: Vulnerability confirmed\n- **2024-07-01**: Patch developed\n- **2024-07-15**: Patch deployed and verified\n\n## References\n\n- OWASP Authentication Cheat Sheet\n- NIST SP 800-63B Authentication Guidelines",
